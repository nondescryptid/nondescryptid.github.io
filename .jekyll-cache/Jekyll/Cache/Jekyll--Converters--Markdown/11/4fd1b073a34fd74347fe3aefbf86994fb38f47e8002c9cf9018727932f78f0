I"<p>Created reusable components in React for a volunteering project.
<!--more--></p>

<p>This project involved some really tight timelines, so I was really just doing stuff manually (i.e. copy-pasting and tweaking things slightly) because it took less effort than thinking through how to add props and make a component reusable. However, I finally got some time to think about and implement it, which was worth the time as it means that we won’t be clogging up the src folder with lots of different files in the future.</p>
