<p>Hello! I‚Äôm Tomoe.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm curious about the union of law, code and design. I like explaining things simply, building things, and competing in pub trivia.</p>

<p>What I‚Äôm trying to do more of: Being a perpetual novice, understanding that <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">prestige is fossilized inspiration</a>, convince people that sidenotes &gt; footnotes.<label for="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">We do not speak of endnotes here.

<p>What I‚Äôm trying to avoid: excessive red tape, meetings that could‚Äôve been emails, <a href="https://dontasktoask.com/">asking to ask</a>, a job that forces me to work regular office hours.</p>
