<p>just me messing with p5js. this page is for parking random stuff, and I think it's a bit of a throwback to the early 2000s when sites were 1) more freewheeling and 2) web design was like, super unhinged.</p>

<p><button onclick="hello()">CASE IN POINT!</button>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /></p>

<script>
    function hello(click){
        alert("Stuff like this, you know?")
    }
</script>
