I"³<p>Handling rejection, rake tasks and hackerrank
<!--more-->
Got the news that I was rejected for Build@Mercari.</p>

<p>Kind of a bummer, but I expected it as I did poorly for the Hackerrank test. I havenâ€™t been exposed to enough types of problems (and solutions/approaches), and need to continue working on it.</p>

<p>What I did today:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Made a 100 days section for my website. Iâ€™ll use this as a journal of sorts.</li>
  <li>Hackerrank: Plus-Minus; Mini-Max Sum</li>
  <li>Site reorganisation: added 100daysofcode directory + its own _posts directory; moved _posts out of the root directory to its own directory (posts/_posts).</li>
  <li>Wrote rake task to create new post in 100daysofcode</li>
  <li>Useful link of the day: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41660514/pulling-from-specific-subfolders-using-for-post-in-site-posts">Pulling from specific subfolders using {% for post in site.posts %}</a></li>
</ul>
