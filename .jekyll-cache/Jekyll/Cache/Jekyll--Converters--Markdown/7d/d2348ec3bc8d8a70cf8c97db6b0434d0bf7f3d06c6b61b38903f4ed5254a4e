I"Ë<p>Flexbox shenanigans!</p>

<!--more-->

<p><strong><a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">Flexbox Froggy</a></strong> â€“ completed this today!  itâ€™s a great resource that teaches you about the differences between various properties that work with flex, like align-content and align-items. Highly recommend. Doesnâ€™t take long to complete.</p>

<p><strong>Volunteering project</strong>: Got a component to take JSON data (messages) from an API, set state and use the state to generate divs for each message. So if there are 5 messages, 5 divs are generated. Used media query + flex to display 2 columns only when screen size is above a certain threshold, so that it isnâ€™t awfully small on mobile. No demo as itâ€™s a private repo :(</p>

<p>Side note: Todayâ€™s a public holiday and Iâ€™m glad I managed to sit down for 1.5h to focus on learning the stuff needed to build my component. Iâ€™m usually very drained on other days as I have to be out of the house.</p>
