I"§<p>I returned to CS50 after a long time. I have a minor regret about not having finished it, so Iâ€™m going to try and get it done this time round. I usually feel terrible about my skills, but Iâ€™ve realised that Iâ€™ve grown a lot after attempting Mario (more) and realising I got it a lot faster than my younger self would have back then (although I had to keep looking up C syntax and dealing with the missing ;s).</p>
