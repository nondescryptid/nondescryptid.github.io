<p>Hello! I‚Äôm Tomoe.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm curious about the union of law, code and design. I like explaining things simply, building things, and competing in pub trivia.</p>

<p>What I‚Äôm trying to do more of: Being a perpetual novice, understanding that <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">prestige is fossilized inspiration</a>, convince people that sidenotes &gt; footnotes.<label for="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">We do not speak of endnotes here. Sidenotes, however, are imbued with the kind of joy that going off-trail on a hike has. </span></p>

<p>What I‚Äôm trying to avoid: excessive red tape, meetings that could‚Äôve been emails, <a href="https://dontasktoask.com/">asking to ask</a>, a job that forces me to work regular office hours.</p>

          <div><p>This month I‚Äôve been working through CS50. I‚Äôve also managed to get into a semi-routine, which is a big first and surprise to me. I learn/code for the first 1.5h of my day (whenever my waking time might be) before moving on to my work obligations. This might not work for everyone as I happen to be privileged enough to work from home + have a really understanding supervisor who gives me autonomy regarding work hours and recognises that learning is part of my job.</p>

<p>This month I‚Äôve coded on the following days in Oct: a = [6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. The dev console tells me that means it‚Äôs been 21 days (used a.length because I was too lazy to count it manually). Which means I‚Äôm almost halfway through the 100 days (in total, not in a row).</p>

          <div><p>I returned to CS50 after a long time. I have a minor regret about not having finished it, so I‚Äôm going to try and get it done this time round. I usually feel terrible about my skills, but I‚Äôve realised that I‚Äôve grown a lot after attempting Mario (more) and realising I got it a lot faster than my younger self would have back then (although I had to keep looking up C syntax and dealing with the missing ;s).</p>

          <div><p>Learnt more about Chrome extensions by updating the manifest of a Chrome extension that wasn‚Äôt working for me. Was chatting with a friend (<a href="https://github.com/kiittsunne">@kiittsuune</a>) about how SimplyGo doesn‚Äôt total up transactions for you, and they put together a <a href="https://gist.github.com/kiittsunne/ff4a5b6faba000fff4fbbd02c4d640d6">Chrome extension</a> in a night. However, it wasn‚Äôt working for me (i.e. when I clicked the extension icon, nothing would happen) until I modified the manifest in line with Chrome‚Äôs dev documentation. You can check it out <a href="https://gist.github.com/nondescryptid/78504cab609dc189620736745f829e2a">here</a></p>
