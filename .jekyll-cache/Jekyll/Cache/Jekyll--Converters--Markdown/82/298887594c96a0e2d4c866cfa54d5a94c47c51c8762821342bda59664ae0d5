<p>Hello! I’m Tomoe.</p>

<!-- I'm curious about law, code and design. I like explaining things simply, building things, sidenotes (> footnotes > endnotes) and taking part in pub quizzes.  -->

<p>Once upon a time, I studied law. Now I am trying to learn how to be better friends with machines and get them to do things for me.</p>

<p>Currently, I am helping to train a model to recognise entities in (Japanese) DMCA complaints.<label for="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Undergrad Research Assistant, NUS Law Centre for Technology, Robotics, AI and the Law (A/P Daniel Seng). You should read about his <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/lumen-researcher-interview-series-professor-daniel-seng">doctorate journey</a> </span> I’ve also helped with coding Chinese interview data<label for="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Undergrad Research Assistant, Dr Benjamin M. Chen. This was my first job in college, and I found out about it while chatting with one of the librarians about whether they were still hiring people to shelve books. </span>, making infographics about matrimonial asset division <label for="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Volunteer with the Legal Aid Bureau’s LegalTech team. Lovely people. I could let myself in and out of the office like a cat, because I didn’t have enforced working hours. </span>, and building a web app for a non-profit to manage client intake and matching with volunteers <label for="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">TechLadies Bootcamp (for women with basic programming background). My teammates were all working full-time jobs, and I am in awe of them. </span>.</p>

<p>What I’m trying to do more of: Being a perpetual novice, understanding that <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">prestige is fossilized inspiration</a>, convince people that sidenotes &gt; footnotes.<label for="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">We do not speak of endnotes here. Sidenotes, however, are imbued with the kind of joy that going off-trail on a hike has. </span></p>

<p>What I’m trying to avoid: excessive red tape, meetings that could’ve been emails, <a href="https://dontasktoask.com/">asking to ask</a>, a job that forces me to work regular office hours.</p>
