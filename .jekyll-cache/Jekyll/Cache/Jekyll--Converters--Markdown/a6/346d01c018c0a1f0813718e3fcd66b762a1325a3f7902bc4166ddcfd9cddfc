I"¹<p>Got the news that I was rejected for Build@Mercari.

Kind of a bummer, but I expected it as I did poorly for the Hackerrank test. I havenâ€™t been exposed to enough types of problems (and solutions/approaches), and need to continue working on it.</p>

<p>What I did today:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Made a 100 days section for my website. Iâ€™ll use this as a journal of sorts.</li>
  <li>Hackerrank: Plus-Minus; Mini-Max Sum</li>
</ul>
