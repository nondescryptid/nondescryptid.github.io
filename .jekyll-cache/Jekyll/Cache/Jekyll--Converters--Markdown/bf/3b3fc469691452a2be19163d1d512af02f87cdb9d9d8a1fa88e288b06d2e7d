I"«<p>Learnt more about Chrome extensions by updating the manifest of a Chrome extension that wasnâ€™t working for me. Was chatting with a friend (<a href="https://github.com/kiittsunne">@kiittsuune</a>) about how SimplyGo doesnâ€™t total up transactions for you, and they put together a <a href="https://gist.github.com/kiittsunne/ff4a5b6faba000fff4fbbd02c4d640d6">Chrome extension</a> in a night. However, it wasnâ€™t working for me (i.e. when I clicked the extension icon, nothing would happen) until I modified the manifest in line with Chromeâ€™s dev documentation. You can check it out <a href="https://gist.github.com/nondescryptid/78504cab609dc189620736745f829e2a">here</a></p>
