I"›<p>Tried out implementing a UI for question-answering with BERT (using functions written by Chris McCormick) on Streamlit at <a href="https://bert.tomoe.asia">bert.tomoe.asia</a> but it crashes when there are long spans of text entered â€“ not sure if itâ€™s due to memory constraints (free tier has 800MB of memory) or what. Iâ€™ll try using a smaller BERT model tomorrow and see if it makes a difference.</p>
