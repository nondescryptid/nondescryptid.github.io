<p>I attended a StackX meetup yesterday and decided to poke about GovTech’s github repos. Seeing the SGDS provoked me to think about <em>my</em> own site’s accessibility. There’s some tech debt in the sense that I’m using Jekyll, and need to figure out how the html in my site is generated. If I were coding everything by myself with HTML+CSS+JS, it’d probably be a lot easier to just tweak the site’s html directly. So this is the main todo.</p>

<p>Resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.goring.org/resources/accessibility.html">Accessibility with Jekyll Pages</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Also finished FreeCodeCamp’s regex section, although regex still feels very mind-bending to me. Should look for more exercises so it becomes a matter of muscle memory.</p>
