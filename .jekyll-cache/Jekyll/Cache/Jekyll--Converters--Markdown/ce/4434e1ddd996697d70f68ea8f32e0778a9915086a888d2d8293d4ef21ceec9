<h1 id="context">Context</h1>

<p>I was helping with organising a conference that involved an experiential VR component, where conference participants could try out apps on the Oculus Quest 2. However, one of the applications featured was a game on Steam that had no native Oculus app to install. <label for="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">P.S. This was SR4-2, if you attended the conference. </span></p>

<p>This meant that we had to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Download the Oculus app for PC (btw it has no Mac support)</li>
  <li>Pair the Oculus with the PC via a wired connection (USB-C) or Air Link (wireless, via WiFi)</li>
  <li>Start the game in Steam and choose ‚ÄúLaunch with Steam VR‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<p>And the conference was a hybrid conference, so we also had to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Figure out how to stream what was happening on the Oculus to Zoom</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-not-just-connect-it-with-a-wired-connection">Why not just connect it with a wired connection?</h2>
<p>We could‚Äôve used a wired connection, but there was a concern about the experience being suboptimal (range of movement being limited by the length of the USB-C cable) and also risking participants tripping over wires.</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-air-link-and-knock-on-problems-with-streaming">Problems with Air Link and knock-on problems with streaming</h2>
<p>The PC we were using had no WiFi, and Oculus Air Link needs WiFi to work.<label for="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/introducing-oculus-air-link-a-wireless-way-to-play-pc-vr-games-on-oculus-quest-2-plus-infinite-office-updates-support-for-120-hz-on-quest-2-and-more/">Oculus Blog, Introducing Oculus Air Link</a> </span></p>

<p>The casting feature in Oculus (not in Air Link/wired mode) lets you show what the Oculus user is seeing if you log in on <a href="https://www.oculus.com/casting/">oculus.com/casting</a> on Chromium browsers, when both the browser‚Äôs device and the Oculus headset are on the same network. This feature is not available if you‚Äôre connected to a PC, so you need to find some other way to show what‚Äôs going on.</p>

<p>For the conference, we were sharing the screen of a monitor that had 5 different Chrome windows logged on to the headsets‚Äô accounts. The 6th headset was the one that was linked to a PC, that couldn‚Äôt be shown with the same method.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Acquire WiFi Adapter (We used an <a href="https://www.edimax.com/edimax/merchandise/merchandise_detail/data/edimax/global/wireless_adapters_ac1750_dual-band/ew-7833uac">Edimax AC1750</a>)</li>
  <li>Set it up - install driver and whatnot</li>
  <li>Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Mobile hotspot</li>
  <li>Turn on Mobile Hotspot</li>
  <li>Connect your Oculus headset to the PC‚Äôs hotspot</li>
  <li>Turn on Airlink -&gt; select your PC from the list of devices -&gt; click Launch</li>
  <li>Launch your Steam game with Steam VR</li>
  <li>Use OBS Virtual Camera to do Window Capture of the Steam game‚Äôs window, then Start Virtual Camera</li>
  <li>Join Zoom Meeting and change camera output to OBS Camera</li>
</ol>
