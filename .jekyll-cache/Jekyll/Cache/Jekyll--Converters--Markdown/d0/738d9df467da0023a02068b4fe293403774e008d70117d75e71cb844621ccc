<p>Hello! I’m Tomoe.</p>

<!-- I'm curious about law, code and design. I like explaining things simply, building things, sidenotes (> footnotes > endnotes) and taking part in pub quizzes.  -->

<p>Once upon a time, I studied law. Now I am trying to learn how to be better friends with machines and get them to do things for me.
<!-- 
Currently, I am helping to train a model to recognise entities in (Japanese) DMCA complaints.<label for='sidenote-id' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'></label><input type='checkbox' id='sidenote-id' class='margin-toggle'/><span class='sidenote'>Undergrad Research Assistant, NUS Law Centre for Technology, Robotics, AI and the Law (A/P Daniel Seng). You should read about his <a href='https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/lumen-researcher-interview-series-professor-daniel-seng'>doctorate journey.</a> </span> I've also helped with coding Chinese interview data<label for='sidenote-id' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'></label><input type='checkbox' id='sidenote-id' class='margin-toggle'/><span class='sidenote'>Undergrad Research Assistant, Dr <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2TnOeP0AAAAJ&hl=en'>Benjamin M. Chen</a>. This was my first job in college, and I remain grateful having the chance to work on something fun in my first year when school felt very dismal. </span>, making infographics about matrimonial asset division <label for='sidenote-id' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'></label><input type='checkbox' id='sidenote-id' class='margin-toggle'/><span class='sidenote'>Volunteer, Legal Aid Bureau's LegalTech team (super nice people).

<p>What I’m trying to do more of: Being a perpetual novice, understanding that <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">prestige is fossilized inspiration</a>, convince people that sidenotes &gt; footnotes.<label for="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-id" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">We do not speak of endnotes here. Sidenotes, however, are imbued with the kind of joy that going off-trail on a hike has. </span></p>

<p>What I’m trying to avoid: excessive red tape, meetings that could’ve been emails, <a href="https://dontasktoask.com/">asking to ask</a>, a job that forces me to work regular office hours.</p>

          <div><p>Tried out implementing a UI for question-answering with BERT (using functions written by Chris McCormick) on Streamlit at <a href="bert.tomoe.asia">bert.tomoe.asia</a> but it crashes when there are long spans of text entered – not sure if it’s due to memory constraints (free tier has 800MB of memory) or what. I’ll try using a smaller BERT model tomorrow and see if it makes a difference.</p>
