I"V<p>Using .filter(), and thinking about reusable components
<!--more--></p>

<h1 id="volunteering">Volunteering</h1>
<p>Learned to use .filter() to filter messages for various recipients from a larger array of messages. This is quite a rushed job so I’ve been writing a lot of inelegant code. One improvement I want to make is to create a reusable components that I can pass props into, because a lot of the things I’m making have the same template but with a few variables that are tweaked.</p>

<p>Conducted a demo/training on how to use Git to collaborate. I realise I quite enjoy writing documentation and teaching, although how skilled I am is another question altogether.</p>

<p>I’ve also disappeared for a month and have done programming in the interim, just that I wasn’t very diligent about recording it. :P</p>
