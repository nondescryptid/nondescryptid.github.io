I"ì<p>This month Iâ€™ve been working through CS50. Iâ€™ve also managed to get into a semi-routine, which is a big first and surprise to me. I learn/code for the first 1.5h of my day (whenever my waking time might be) before moving on to my work obligations. This might not work for everyone as I happen to be privileged enough to work from home + have a really understanding supervisor who gives me autonomy regarding work hours and recognises that learning is part of my job.</p>

<p>This month Iâ€™ve coded on the following days in Oct: a = [6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. The dev console tells me that means itâ€™s been 21 days (used a.length because I was too lazy to count it manually). Which means Iâ€™m almost halfway through the 100 days (in total, not in a row).</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I restarted CS50 for 2 main reasons:</p>

<p>(1) closure</p>

<p>Partially to get closure on the fact that it was the first thing I ever touched relating to code, but I never finished it because I was very new and not at a state where I have the kind of will and faith to finish it. But itâ€™s been a good month so far â€“ Iâ€™ve learnt a lot, and also feel like I can see how Iâ€™m very different from the kid 4 years ago touching Scratch and C for the first time.</p>

<p>(2) improving my foundations</p>

<p>My data structures &amp; algo knowledge is really weak and I wanted to get a better handle on things like pointers, hash tables. After going through the first 5 weeks of content in C, I can appreciate why they force us to use C â€“ youâ€™ll understand memory allocation and the relevance of linked lists a lot better when you understand the kinds of problems faced by storing stuff in contiguous slots of memory.</p>

<p>Anyway, strongly recommend doing the course. And also would like to remind anyone whoâ€™s been discouraged by the course that itâ€™s okay to take a step back and learn other things, then return to it.</p>

<p>Things work out in the fullness of time.</p>
