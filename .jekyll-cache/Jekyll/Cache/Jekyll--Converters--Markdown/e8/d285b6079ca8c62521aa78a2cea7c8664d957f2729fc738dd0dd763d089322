<p>One of the more interesting things I learned today was that you can use the ternary operator (a.k.a question mark) to make code more succinct.</p>

<p>Instead of</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>function returnLarger(a, b) {
    if (a &gt; b) {
        return a 
    } else {
        return b
    }
}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You could just write</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>function returnLarger(a, b) {
    return a &gt; b ? a : b 
}    
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Attended a talk today that featured a software engineer who had no formal CS background, which was pretty heartening. She mentioned a really good way of thinking about your career, namely the importance of developing these 4 things: skillset (functional, conscious competence), mindset (self beliefs and self-awareness), teamwork, and network (influence and relationships). A lot of your job comprises things that aren’t technical skills because we live in a society.</p>

<p>Now that COVID measures are easing up a bit, I’m trying to push myself to attend more meetups and meet new people. I was incredibly nervous at my first meetup and probably committed some kind of social faux pas, but never mind. It’ll get better with practice.</p>
