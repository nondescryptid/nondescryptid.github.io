This involves several questions: 
1. How can migrant workers (current or former Work Permit holders) create a SingPass account? 

- linguistic inclusion
    - Even if things are in english, terms should correspond to the actual sections in the document requested 


2. Estimating the potential size of the problem: How many migrant workers are there in Singapore? People who might be affected are a subset of the group. 
- Probably at least a million.
