I want to make things I care about/find fun. Sometimes they're useful, sometimes they're not.

Some of the things I want to learn more about:
- representing legal knowledge 
- automating the boring stuff
- generative art 

<br>
Some things you can pay me to do:
- proofreading (academic articles and whatnot)
- fixing random bugs 
- making silly pixel art (i made the badge in the navbar!)
- researching and writing (but not for people's assignments - go do your own homework)
