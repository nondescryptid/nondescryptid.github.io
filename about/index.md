Ex-law, working towards becoming a software engineer. I'm not experienced enough to talk about specialisations, besides the fact that I'd like to start off with exposure to the full stack. 

I had written a very long intro, then scrapped it as there are only a few things people need to know. 

In a past life, I studied law. I'm now working on detaching myself from the idea that I have to become a lawyer to avoid wasting my degree. I realised that I was a lot more more motivated to work on learning to code (which I had no obligation to), compared to my actual degree (for which there is a lot of obligation to do things for). 

I'm excited about working on stuff that 
1) improves access to justice;
2) is small but nifty;
3) is a lot of silly fun
