Used to study law, now I don't. {% sidenote "sidenote-id" "Mainly because I graduated and don't really want to practice" %}

I want to make things I care about/find fun. Sometimes they're useful, sometimes they're not.

Some of the things I want to learn more about:
- representing legal knowledge 
- automating the boring stuff
- generative art
