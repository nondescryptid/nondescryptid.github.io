Inspired by Annie Rauwerda's [lots of links](https://annierau.com/LOL-lots-of-links). Links are in the format 
```
YYYY-MM-DD : [label](hyperlink) | my comments
```
in Markdown (since I'm using Hugo), but it'll appear differently when you inspect this page since it generates HTML. Anyway, the point is to have a consistent format that I can use to do something fun with this data later on. 

Or I could use this as a teaching tool too -- an easy site to practice scraping where consent's not an issue. If you want to scrape this page, just go ahead. You can also visit this page's `.md` file in my site's [Github repo](https://github.com/nondescryptid/nondescryptid.github.io) if you want to work with markdown files instead. If you do something with it, please email me at `hi [at] this domain name` as I'd love to hear about it :) 

How I decide to post a link: Does it make me feel curious OR happy? If yes, I'll post it.

2023-09-06: [Karel Kubicek et al., Checking Websitesâ€™ GDPR Consent Compliance for Marketing Emails](https://karelkubicek.github.io/post/reg-pets) | I like questions that care about not just what the law is, but how agents actually respond to it. Also props for creating a unique email address for every service they signed up for, so they could track the sources of marketing emails...the other projects supervised by Karel Kubicek also look really cool (one is a Master's thesis about GDPR-related Github Issues)

2023-09-05: [Casual Birder is an Endearing Game About Photographing Birds](https://casualphotophile.com/2023/07/26/casual-birder-a-video-game-about-photographing-birds/) |  Sroyon recommended this review to me and it's delightful. A handheld game where you take photos of birds. Done by the same folks that published Untitled Goose Game.  

2023-09-05: [An Empirical Study & Evaluation of Modern CAPTCHAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12108) | CAPTCHAs kinda suck for accessibility, and now it appears that bots solve CAPTCHAs faster and more accurately than humans (see Page 10, Table 3). I think we should just throw the whole CAPTCHA thing away.

2023-09-03 : [ohmygit](https://ohmygit.org/) | So cute, you get to learn git with a game and watch your git timeline grow as you make commits. I wish I could've started learning git with this instead of whatever I was doing back in 2020...
