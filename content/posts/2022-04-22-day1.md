Handling rejection, rake tasks and hackerrank
<!--more-->
Got the news that I was rejected for Build@Mercari. 

Kind of a bummer, but I expected it as I did poorly for the Hackerrank test. I haven't been exposed to enough types of problems (and solutions/approaches), and need to continue working on it. 

What I did today: 
- Made a 100 days section for my website. I'll use this as a journal of sorts.
- Hackerrank: Plus-Minus; Mini-Max Sum
- Site reorganisation: added 100daysofcode directory + its own _posts directory; moved _posts out of the root directory to its own directory (posts/_posts).
- Wrote rake task to create new post in 100daysofcode 
- Useful link of the day: [Pulling from specific subfolders using {% for post in site.posts %}](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41660514/pulling-from-specific-subfolders-using-for-post-in-site-posts)
