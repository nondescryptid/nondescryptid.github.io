Added [Catche](https://try.catche.co/) to my site. It adds instant search. Click on the magnifying glass in the lower right of the screen!

Mapped domain (tomoe.asia) to my current Github Pages site.

# Hackerrank
## [Time conversion](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/one-month-preparation-kit-time-conversion/problem?isFullScreen=true)

Inelegant solution, but it works. It's quite late now so I'll think of a more elegant solution another day: 
```
def timeConversion(s):
    # Write your code
    if s[-2:] == "PM":
        s = s.replace("PM", "")
        digits = int(s[0:2])
        if digits != 12:
            digits += 12
            digits = str(digits)
            s = digits + s[2:]
        else:
            pass

    else:
        s = s.replace("AM", "")
        if s[0:2] == "12":
            s = "00" + s[2:]
    return s

```

## Sparse Arrays

Inelegant attempt that didn't work (it's like 2 now so I'm going to just sleep and do this again tomorrow)

```
def matchingStrings(strings, queries):
    # initialise array to track results
    results = []
    # Make results arr as long as queries
    results = [0 for i in range(len(queries))]
    for query in queries:
        for string in strings:
            if query == string:
                results[queries.index(query)] += 1 
            else: 
                pass
    return results 
```

{% marginnote "margin-noteid" "I should get a lot more familiar with Python methods. Knowing .count() would've saved me so much time." %}
```
def matchingStrings(strings, queries):
    # Write your code here
    results=[] 
    count=0
    for i in queries:
        results.append(strings.count(i)) 
    return results
```

```
def matchingStrings(strings, queries):
    return [strings.count (q) for q in queries]
```
