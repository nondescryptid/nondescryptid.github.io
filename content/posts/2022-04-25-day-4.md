Not much from me today. <!--more--> I'm going to move away from grinding Hackerrank and devote my time to studying data structures and algorithms by going through an online course before I move to stuff like leetcode/hackerrank. 

Added buttons to the Blackjack game where players can choose to hit or stand with, instead of typing "hit" and "stand" into the input bar. 

Small win of the day: Graduated from the Rocket Academy Basics course today. I'll sort of miss seeing my classmates around now that we aren't meeting twice a week.
