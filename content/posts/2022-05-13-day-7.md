Starting to think about whether this site is accessible, how to test if it is accessible, and how to make it accessible if it isn't

# Thinking about my personal site's accessibility

I attended a StackX meetup yesterday and decided to poke about GovTech's github repos. Seeing the SGDS provoked me to think about *my* own site's accessibility. There's some tech debt in the sense that I'm using Jekyll, and need to figure out how the html in my site is generated. If I were coding everything by myself with HTML+CSS+JS, it'd probably be a lot easier to just tweak the site's html directly. So this is the main todo.

Also finished FreeCodeCamp's regex section, although regex still feels very mind-bending to me. Should look for more exercises so it becomes a matter of muscle memory.
