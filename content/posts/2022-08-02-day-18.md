Created reusable components in React for a volunteering project.
<!--more--> 

This project involved some really tight timelines, so I was really just doing stuff manually (i.e. copy-pasting and tweaking things slightly) because it took less effort than thinking through how to add props and make a component reusable. However, I finally got some time to think about and implement it, which was worth the time as it means that we won't be clogging up the ```src``` folder with lots of different files in the future.
