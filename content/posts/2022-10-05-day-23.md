Learnt more about Chrome extensions by updating the manifest of a Chrome extension that wasn't working for me. Was chatting with a friend ([@kiittsuune](https://github.com/kiittsunne)) about how SimplyGo doesn't total up transactions for you, and they put together a [Chrome extension](https://gist.github.com/kiittsunne/ff4a5b6faba000fff4fbbd02c4d640d6) in a night. However, it wasn't working for me (i.e. when I clicked the extension icon, nothing would happen) until I modified the manifest in line with Chrome's dev documentation. You can check it out [here](https://gist.github.com/nondescryptid/78504cab609dc189620736745f829e2a)
