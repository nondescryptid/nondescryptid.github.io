title: day 52 - adding filtering to the EMNLP 2022 paper view
---

Added filtering by conference track. I stored the list of unique tracks in a file called track.js and exported it to components that needed it. Mapped values in tracks to their own ```<option></option>``` elements in a dropdown, and then added conditions to check whether any option was selected (if not I would just show all papers). Added labels for each card to show conference track, submission type and acceptance status.
