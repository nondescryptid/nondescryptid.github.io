title: day 60 - today I will refuse to be useful
---
Today I didn't want to be 'useful' or make something that is a means to an end. I just felt like playing and let myself do that instead. welcome to [my room](https://inmyroom.vercel.app/) where like in real life, things are everywhere and somehow rearrange themselves every time you visit.
