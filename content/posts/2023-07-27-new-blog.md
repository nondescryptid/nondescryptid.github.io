title: "Jekyll to Hugo: Yet another day of being trapped in the site generator karmic cycle"

I have now joined the legions of people who have started their free Github Pages blog with Jekyll, and moved to Hugo. I originally used the Tufte-Jekyll theme, but realised that my stated preference (sidenotes!!) was very far from my revealed preferences (I hyperlink in my text directly a lot more). I also value having a nice table of contents. I want faster builds because this blog will be pretty image-heavy in time to come, because I've got a bunch of film cameras to review. 

Hopefully, there won't be a change in my site anytime soon. Sorry if I broke your RSS feed or anything.
