The strange thing about cameras is that brands keep calling the same thing by different names. Why can't we just have a unique identifier for each thing that exists? It's like how the Canon EOS 750D is also called the Rebel T6i (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_750D#:~:text=The%20Canon%20EOS%20750D%2C%20known,Canon%20on%20February%206%2C%202015)). 

The Konica TZ-635 is no different - It appears to be called the Konica Zoom FR 635 too (like in this [Youtube video by Meracasee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1YJx2lwB4g) or this [random ebay listing](https://www.ebay.com/itm/165295050428)). 

There might be many Konica TZ-635s (or FR-635s) in the world, but this one is mine (until further notice).

I found it in the Kyoto-Katsura outlet of Hard Off (a Japanese chain that sells used electronics) for JPY2200 (about SGD20.36). Cameras in the junk section are usually untested, but this one happened to be tested! The sticker says that the shutter and flash are working, but the camera has not actually been tested with a roll of film. I tested the camera myself with the batteries I'd brought along and confirmed that the sticker was telling the truth.

Besides the problem with names, film cameras also face a bit of an archival problem -- manuals aren't always available. 

Whenever I can't find manuals for my exact camera model (like the Fuji Super 115), I try to find others that kinda look like it. In this case, the manual for the Konica Z-Up 60 will do. The buttons/interface are arranged the same as the TZ-635, even though the front of the camera looks very different. 

Someone is selling a [printed copy of the manual for USD13.95](https://www.camera-manual.com/konica-z-up-60-manual-6074), but you can get a free online copy if you're willing to look at some Japanese by going on [gizport](http://gizport.jp/manual/1860464/?id=47573). If you know Korean, you can watch [Meracasee's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1YJx2lwB4g) where they go through the features of this camera. 

# Things to note 
This is a TL;DR of the Japanese Z-Up 60 manual and my own experience. 
- This uses AA batteries
- Lens: 35mm f/5.8 - 60mm f/9.5
- Takes ISO 100-400 film
- Distance:
  - For regular shooting: 1.60m to infinity (35mm) / 2.40m to infinity (60mm)
  - Flash: 1.00m-2.60m / 1.30m - 2.50m (based on ISO400 colour negative film)
  - Macro (Manual says "Close-up"): 0.50m - 0.80m / 0.55m - 0.70m
- Flash is automatic and cannot be turned off unless you set it to Landscape mode 
- Self-timer mode: The timer lasts for 10 seconds. The indicator light will flash for 7 seconds, and then the flash itself will flash for 3 seconds before the shutter is activated.

Sunglasses and mask were drawn on courtesy of me and my laptop trackpad.

I just found it kind of funny that this was positioned right in front of a road. I nearly walked onto the road because I was trying to get a better look at it. Perhaps "coming soon" refers to oncoming cars.

Autofocus is a hit-or-miss thing. This one didn't focus quite well, but most photos are a hit for me. I'm not very fussed about images being perfect - if I did, I wouldn't be using film or point-and-shoots...

# Thoughts 

I really, really like this camera and I don't think I'll be selling it. Its build is solid enough that I can throw it into my bag without having to worry if it'll survive. I'm happy with the limited sets of features. I like this more than the Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 15, where you can deactivate flash but it takes 6 presses of the MODE button.
