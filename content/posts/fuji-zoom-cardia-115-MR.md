This camera is the more busted cousin of the [Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 115](https://tomoe.asia/posts/2023-08-06-fuji-zoom-cardia-super-115/) I've talked about previously. The full name of this camera is the Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 115 MR, but I haven't figured out how it differs from the regular Fuji Super 115 (which seems to be a rebranded Samsung camera), or what "MR" even stands for. If you'd like to learn more about this camera's features, I recommend that you check out the Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 115 blog post. This one is really just for photo samples.

The exterior condition really isn't the best -- there are lots of scratches and a crack on the viewfinder. I was, however, very surprised by how the photos turned out. 

Without further ado - some photos from this camera shot with Fuji C200.

Greens and blues really pop on this. When there's not enough light, shadows appear to have a strong green tint. I'm just very surprised by how this performed, considering that I fished these out of the junk section from Hard-Off. 

At last, I inch closer towards testing and reviewing all the cameras I've thrifted, and writing a Grand Unified Post on how to properly shop the junk section at Hard-Off in Japan.
