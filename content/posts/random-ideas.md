In the past month (I forget the exact time frame), Reddit [introduced Streaks](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1e7njll/what_is_a_reddit_streak/) - as if I needed more reminders that I'm chronically online. 

I realised that behind this is probably a product person that had to write a PRD, do A/B testing and then release this feature into the wild. Inspired by this, I've decided to keep a running list of odd ideas. 

Someone older and wiser said to me: "If you keep throwing things at a wall, there'll be something that sticks." (this was in relation to academic publishing/journals and how persistence is one of the more important academic virtues, but it applies here too).

# running list of odd takes/ideas
- [`git lucky`, where it randomly commits something from your git stash](https://kopiti.am/@nondescryptid/112790666982898034)
- matching pet names: Phillips, Torx, Tri-Wing etc. The fun part is using Phillips for your first pet before surprising people with the fact that they're all actually named after screwdriver bits. 
> Imagine saying this: "My cat is called Phil, it's short for Phillips #00"
- paying extra for a child-free flight (I know an inclusive society means including children and I will live by this rule in public spaces, but I really really want to opt-out of a red-eye 15-hour flight where someone's kid is crying)
