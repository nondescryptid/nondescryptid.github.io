This marks the first week of being temporarily free-range. I haven't figured out the right term for it yet. I [joked about this a bit](https://kopiti.am/@nondescryptid/112145128076061313) 2 weeks ago, but "temporarily free-range" is my top contender for now. I'm avoiding calling it a sabbatical because it reminds me too much of tenured faculty, and "microdosing retirement" sounds a bit too laid back. What matters (and what's kind of scary) about this time is that nobody can tell me what to do.

In light of this, I've started off my first week by just letting myself be a degenerate. I've just been sleeping a lot - more than I have in a long time. This must be how cats feel when they curl up to take a nap in the middle of the day. 

If I had to choose a word for the week, I'd choose "maintenance". If I had to choose 8 words, it would be "doing things I've avoided for the longest time". 

I've spent a lot of time this week sleeping, doing laundry, unpacking from the move, taking care of plants, and sharpening knives (sidenote: I plan on going to a knife shop next week to learn how to properly sharpen a knife and also level the whetstone I'm using. It was my grandfather's, so it might very well be older than me). Haven't done a lot of programming-related work besides trying to learn SQL. I've somehow avoided it for the longest time,like going to the dentist - but I have overcome that this week and now have very clean teeth. 

And since no update is ever complete without some minor bug introduction - I updated my Hugo version and now my `date published / reading time` sections are borked, but I won't let it stop me from yapping online and publishing my posts anyway. 

Happy update: My website actually looks fine! Hooray! But the problem happens when I use `hugo serve` locally.
