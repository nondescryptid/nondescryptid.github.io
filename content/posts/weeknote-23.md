It's evidently been a while. I think I procrastinated a lot on weeknotes because I felt like I had nothing to say. Realised I practice a lot of unnecessary self-censorship. In the past few weeks I've started helping someone out with filing a claim with the Small Claims Tribunal (I'm basically someone's Computer Guy because he doesn't have access to a laptop and also is not fluent in English), and also finally updated my [review of classes I took for a graduate certificate](https://tomoe.asia/posts/2023-05-19-nus-grad-cert-computing-foundations/) after much procrastinating (bit of a running theme). I even did something scary (to me). I posted about it on LinkedIn and it did reach someone who might find it useful. Yay for fighting self-censorship : ) 

This week I joined the London Bird Club for a walk, and developed a minor fixation on tomatoes.

**Tomatoes in 3 ways...**
1. Cut into wedges. Dress with olive oil, salt, pepper.
2. Tomato egg noodle, egg drop soup -style: Dice tomatoes and cook them down with olive oil till they become sauce-like. Add broth of choice. Add soy sauce, salt and pepper to your liking and simmer the soup till you're tired of it. Cook noodles in the broth. When it's about to be done, beat an egg and drizzle it into the broth to let it cook. 
3. Yet another tomato egg noodle, but you fry the egg and set it aside. Reintroduce it to the pan when the noodle's almost done. 

No measurements, because I practice vibes-based cooking (just season and taste as you go). 

I will think of more ways to eat my tomatoes. Maybe I'll make a tomato tomyum sauce to eat with my supermarket tortellini.
