title: 'Weeknote 26'

With this I have finally caught up with my weeknote backlog. I aspire to be like [Nika](https://sometimes.digital/weeknotes/) who (1) has a very snazzy layout for weeknotes that's styled like a calendar and (2) is very consistent. Fingers crossed that I actually do sit down on Sunday nights from now on.

Accompanied someone who was serving as a witness to court (anticlimactic as the fella actually being prosecuted didn't show up and somehow got hospitalised the night before trial). Woke up early enough to go for a walk and see a bunch of shrooms I couldn't ID.

Went for a friend's wedding - this is the first I've gone for as an adult. Despite my general cynicism, I love witnessing and celebrating other people's love. What a joy : ) Chinese wedding culture really confuses me though. There are even websites to tell you [what the prevailing ang bao rate is for a banquet dinner based on a wedding venue](https://singaporebrides.com/wedding-ang-bao-rates/)[^1]. Rice Media has a piece titled "[To Hell With Ang Bao Market Rates](https://www.ricemedia.co/to-hell-with-the-ang-bao-market-rate-guides/)". The wedding I went for was at a church with lunch afterwards, so I haven't actually encountered a banquet dinner yet. I haven't really figured out what I'd say if I can't go for someone's wedding because I can't afford it.

[^1]: "ang bao" is Hokkien for red packet (in Mandarin it's 紅包). These are gifts of money that people give during special occasions like weddings and Lunar New Year. 

Worked on fixing a dizzying number of fans this week. Each month I try to make it for my neighbourhood's [Repair Kopitiam](https://repairkopitiam.sg/), which is kind of like a repair meetup where people can bring their faulty appliances and you fix them together. This week involved a lot of thermal fuse replacements and opening up the fan's innards to clean and lubricate.

The funny thing is that opening up a fan to expose the motor's copper coil typically leads to the shaft being slightly misaligned when you secure the covers back on, so we had to whack the shaft (with a screwdriver) until it aligned and started spinning smoothly again...it's always funny when smacking something fixes it. 

We encountered 2 portable blenders that seemed to be "broken", but they were actually working - their indicator lights were flashing as the blender bottle/jug wasn't screwed tightly enough to engage the [microswitch](https://lgswitch.en.made-in-china.com/product/xKiQOpNHhnYw/China-Mini-Micro-Safety-Switch-for-Blender.html) that's underneath the main body's rubber seal. This prevents the blades from working if the bottle/jug isn't screwed on.
