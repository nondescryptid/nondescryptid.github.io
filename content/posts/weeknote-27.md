[juliaplaysgroove](https://www.youtube.com/@juliaplaysgroove) has me convinced that any song can be improved by adding bass. This week I finally got around to making my site-search shortcut CLI tool more usable. I can use a shortcut to search specific sites instead of having to type stuff like `site:forums.developer.nvidia.com` into the search bar. I haven't touched code in ages, and I'm glad to finally be back at it. 

I was reading a piece lately about [Why it feels like everyone in the world is heading to Japan right now](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/06/29/japan/japan-tourism-focus/) and would like to recommend not going to Tokyo/Osaka/Kyoto (or rather, not staying there for too long). 

Instead, if you try some food that you really like, see where it's from and think about whether you'd like to viist. This happened because I got some [soba](https://tamayaseimen.co.jp/en/archives/products/gassan-soba-70) last year from my grandfather (who lives in Nagoya). He volunteers to walk kids to school, and the parents of one of the kids he walked with gave him this whole load of soba as a gift to celebrate their kid finishing elementary school. 

The soba was really good, so I went to look up where it's from: Mt Gassan. Mt Gassan is located in Nishikawa and is part of the "Three Holy Mountains of Dewa [...] situated near the Sea of Japan in Yamagata Prefecture, consisting of Mount Haguro, Mount Gassan and Mount Yudono that represent birth, death and rebirth respectively."[^1] Someone's also got [a really detailed writeup](https://timbunting.com/mountains/gassan/) about hiking Mt Gassan.

There's also lots of good [produce](https://www.gassan-info.com/en/gourmet) like wild vegetables and mushrooms. You can even book a [foraging experience](https://www.byfood.com/experiences/mountain-vegetable-foraging-cooking-lesson-320) where you learn to identify, forage and cook plants :D Check out the prefecture (Nishikawa is part of Yamagata prefecture) on [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/places/yamagata) too. 

Something like this sounds a lot more fun than fighting the crowds in Tokyo/Osaka/Kyoto. There's a certain point where places get a lot less enjoyable because of the sheer population density. E.g.: the [Mt Fuji view from a popular Lawson minimart getting boarded up]( https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/news/kawaguchiko-is-blocking-the-mt-fuji-view-at-this-popular-lawson-store-043024) to discourage tourists from taking photos as the crowds have gotten so bad that it obstructs pedestrian pathways.

I am now taking recommendations from the backs of other food packages.
