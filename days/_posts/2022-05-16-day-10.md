Flexbox shenanigans!

<!--more-->

- Checked out and completed [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) -- it's a great resource that teaches you about the differences between various properties that work with flex, like align-content and align-items. Highly recommend. 

- Volunteering project: Got a component to take JSON data (messages) from an API, set state and use the state to generate divs for each message. So if there are 5 messages, 5 divs are generated. Used media query + flex to display 2 columns only when screen size is above a certain threshold, so that it isn't awfully small on mobile. No demo as it's a private repo :(
