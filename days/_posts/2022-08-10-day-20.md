Started learning Django out of necessity for work. 

<!--more-->

I only managed to spend 30 minutes today on learning Django (got started with virtual env and setting up a django project + understanding the settings file), but I'm glad I spent that time instead of spending no time at all. Putting my learning at the start of the day before other work tasks was nice as it gave me the security of knowing that I'd done some learning by lunchtime, and that I didn't have to learn stuff at the end of the work day at night when my energy's depleted.
