Tried out implementing a UI for question-answering with BERT (using functions written by Chris McCormick) on Streamlit at [bert.tomoe.asia](bert.tomoe.asia) but it crashes when there are long spans of text entered -- not sure if it's due to memory constraints (free tier has 800MB of memory) or what. I'll try using a smaller BERT model tomorrow and see if it makes a difference.
