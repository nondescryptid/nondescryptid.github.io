Finished CS50's final pset which involved learning about Flask. I've just started on my final project -- a site that displays accepted papers for EMNLP 2022. You can check it my work so far at [emnlp2022.tomoe.asia](https://emnlp2022.tomoe.asia) I'm doing this as it's a good opportunity to work with some real-world data and also respond to a problem I'm having -- the list of accepted papers is currently only available in this massive Excel which is incredibly hard to read.

# Things I expect to learn 
- How to build components, and pass props 
- Managing state: how do I pass information from a filter component to the cards components, and update the card components (which show papers) accordingly? 

# Progress so far: 
- Display all papers, and show abstracts on click. 
- Experimented a bit with filtering and checked out [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), but have decided to try to build my components as much as possible so that I know what's going on.
