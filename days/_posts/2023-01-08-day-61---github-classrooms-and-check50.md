I must confess that I've never written a test, but part of my work involves doing that now. I'm learning more about Github Classrooms and how to do autograding. Currently exploring check50 as it allows students to check their own work (as opposed to checks only occurring at the grading stage), but there's a tradeoff in the form of not being able to make private test cases as check50 works with public Github repos. Anyway, besides GH classrooms, I might explore [CodeGrade](https://www.codegrade.com/) and also look for more reflections from educators like Patrick Totzke, who's written about [Partially Automated Assessment of Programming Assignments with Check50
](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~patrick/blog/2021/check50/).
