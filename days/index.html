          <div>from May 6 - May 10 just a lot of Shopify stuff Shopify i’ve been spending most of my time familiarising myself with Shopify because of work.

          <div>Falling off the face of the earth; drinking from a firehose. It’s been more than a week. I’m definitely not fantastic at staying updated – honestly each day is more of “a day where I remembered to document what I was doing”. I think 100daysofcode is a nice guide and...</div>

          <div>Not much from me today. I’m going to move away from grinding Hackerrank and devote my time to studying data structures and algorithms by going through an online course before I move to stuff like leetcode/hackerrank.
