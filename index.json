This happened because I got some soba last year from my grandfather (who lives in Nagoya). He volunteers to walk kids to school, and the parents of one of the kids he walked with gave him this whole load of soba as a gift to celebrate their kid finishing elementary school.\nThe soba was really good, so I went to look up where it\u0026rsquo;s from: Mt Gassan. Mt Gassan is located in Nishikawa and is part of the \u0026ldquo;Three Holy Mountains of Dewa [\u0026hellip;] situated near the Sea of Japan in Yamagata Prefecture, consisting of Mount Haguro, Mount Gassan and Mount Yudono that represent birth, death and rebirth respectively.\u0026rdquo;1 Someone\u0026rsquo;s also got a really detailed writeup about hiking Mt Gassan.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also lots of good produce like wild vegetables and mushrooms. You can even book a foraging experience where you learn to identify, forage and cook plants :D Check out the prefecture (Nishikawa is part of Yamagata prefecture) on iNaturalist too.\nSomething like this sounds a lot more fun than fighting the crowds in Tokyo/Osaka/Kyoto. There\u0026rsquo;s a certain point where places get a lot less enjoyable because of the sheer population density.

Despite my general cynicism, I love witnessing and celebrating other people\u0026rsquo;s love. What a joy : ) Chinese wedding culture really confuses me though. There are even websites to tell you what the prevailing ang bao rate is for a banquet dinner based on a wedding venue1. Rice Media has a piece titled \u0026ldquo;To Hell With Ang Bao Market Rates\u0026rdquo;. The wedding I went for was at a church with lunch afterwards, so I haven\u0026rsquo;t actually encountered a banquet dinner yet. I haven\u0026rsquo;t really figured out what I\u0026rsquo;d say if I can\u0026rsquo;t go for someone\u0026rsquo;s wedding because I can\u0026rsquo;t afford it.\nWorked on fixing a dizzying number of fans this week. Each month I try to make it for my neighbourhood\u0026rsquo;s Repair Kopitiam, which is kind of like a repair meetup where people can bring their faulty appliances and you fix them together. This week involved a lot of thermal fuse replacements and opening up the fan\u0026rsquo;s innards to clean and lubricate.\nThe funny thing is that opening up a fan to expose the motor\u0026rsquo;s copper coil typically leads to the shaft being slightly misaligned when you secure the covers back on, so we had to whack the shaft (with a screwdriver) until it aligned and started spinning smoothly again\u0026hellip;it\u0026rsquo;s always funny when smacking something fixes it.\nWe encountered 2 portable blenders that seemed to be \u0026ldquo;broken\u0026rdquo;, but they were actually working - their indicator lights were flashing as the blender bottle/jug wasn\u0026rsquo;t screwed tightly enough to engage the microswitch that\u0026rsquo;s underneath the main body\u0026rsquo;s rubber seal.

This week covered my final 3 days in London and the long trip home.\nI have learnt that getting film hand-inspected when taking the Eurostar (St Pancras or Gare du Nord) or at Heathrow Airport is a real pain because they say it has to go through the machine as long as your film\u0026rsquo;s under ISO 800. Getting hand inspection done in the US or in Japan has been really easy, so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting so much pushback from other airports.\nAfter texting Sroyon (who is a more serious photographer and more updated than I am), he pointed out that Heathrow has 2 types of machines (CT scan machines and X-ray ones). The two types of machines (evil and good) currently coexist because Heathrow hasn\u0026rsquo;t finished replacing all 146 security lanes\u0026rsquo; worth of machines. Thankfully, my film turned out fine and I could actually get the photos from this trip and write my Raynox ME-606 post.\nMy final 3 days were just spent with friends and walking around a lot. To drive this point home, I had dinner with 2 friends who both live in London but hadn\u0026rsquo;t met each other. This happened after dinner while we were walking:\nSY: [\u0026hellip;] We went on a walk that passes by about 8 grocery stores and then Tomo said \u0026ldquo;wow, walking is so nice\u0026rdquo; and immediately tripped on flat ground.\nV: HAHAHAHA I know she really loves walking\nIf it isn\u0026rsquo;t already abundantly clear \u0026ndash; I love walking.\nAnyway, here are some photos:\nThrifted this from the Queensway outlet of the Royal Trinity Hospice charity shop. It\u0026rsquo;s funny because I don\u0026rsquo;t have a dog. I am the dog and I\u0026rsquo;m walking myself (this would explain why I\u0026rsquo;m very food-motivated and also enjoy walking about).\nGot to see a brat poster in real life. 🫡 (Favourite track off the album is Apple)\nThe largest baked potato of my life at Shepherdess BBQ Cafe. V was viewing a flat in the area and we decided to get lunch there. I thought this would be somewhat small as £10 doesn\u0026rsquo;t usually go very far in London, but I ended up having to take half of it home as I couldn\u0026rsquo;t finish it (P.S. they pack your to-go stuff really nicely too!).\nV is disarmingly friendly and also has this preternatural ability to just start speaking to anybody, anytime.1 While I was washing my hands in the restroom, V found out that the lady who was serving us our food had moved here from Turkey 4 years ago and really loves it \u0026ndash; she said \u0026ldquo;it can be expensive, but if you split it with people it\u0026rsquo;s easy\u0026rdquo; (e.g. rent, or just expenses in general). Then came the question:\nV: Ok so when are you moving to London?\nHonestly would love to, but I need to find a job there first. As someone with no STEM degree who wants to move into software engineering in the year 2024, this feels like trying to get struck by lightning while also winning the lottery. Trying to move countries on top of this is perhaps a bit much. I don\u0026rsquo;t even want to say what I want out loud, because it might sound delusional / open me up to being laughed at.\nwhat i saw while walking Why do pigons do this even when there\u0026rsquo;s a big open space right next to the bridge? Baffling little guys. Still cute though.\nMallards (i think) and a coot. I love coots. They look so goofy and the babies have red faces. If you are interested in London wildlife, please check out Gehan de Silva Wijeyratne\u0026rsquo;s blog (I use full names for people I don\u0026rsquo;t really know personally) - he has a 3-part series of recommendations for where to go. I met him on a walk with the London Bird Club in Week 23 and he gave me a pamphlet for the London Natural History Society.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a bit of lore behind the walk. I nearly missed it because my train got delayed and I reached the Baker Street Sherlock Holmes Statue about 10 minutes late. I figured that the worst case was that I\u0026rsquo;d have a nice walk on my own, so I decided to head to Regent\u0026rsquo;s Park anyway after making a blind guess on what route they\u0026rsquo;d probably take and somehow managed to catch up with them.\nIf you are ever late for a walk and looking for birders, just look for a group of people where everyone has a pair of binoculars.\nI did not have binoculars and ended up taking in everything with my raw, astigmatism-riddled eyes and glasses.\nI really want to know what the lore behind this memorial bench is. Wanted to put it on OpenBenches, but realised someone had already beaten me to it by a year. Hope Samuel Jackson Daly is having a good giggle wherever they might be.\nNo photos for the next thing, but I went to see the Angel Comedy Club\u0026rsquo;s free shows. Technically free, but more precisely, it\u0026rsquo;s pay-as-you-wish with a £15 suggested contribution. I try to go whenever I\u0026rsquo;m around. You get to see a variety of material (each night has about 6 folks), and honestly I\u0026rsquo;ve paid more for worse experiences at some ticketed shows elsewhere so I\u0026rsquo;d happily pay the suggested £15 for Angel anytime.\nAnyway, this is what my version of London looks like. Consider this my attempt at travel blogging. The next step is to actually catch up on my weeknote backlog and ritualise the act of actually writing things on Sunday night, instead of 2 weeks later.\nRandom thought: It would be nice to be a photographer for shy people. Like people who are quite camera-shy but would want a few nice photos of themselves that they like.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve witnessed this a lot, but I\u0026rsquo;m still always amazed whenever I see it happen. To drive this point home - I met V at the bus stop after an NUS Hackers meetup sometime in 2018. I generally don\u0026rsquo;t speak to strangers (in real life) because of a mix of fear and awkwardness, but recall that V is not only friendly, but is instead disarmingly friendly.

We rarely get to hang out in the easy and pointless way that most friendships are made as kids/students, so whatever time we have to pointlessly hang out, cook, and wander about is precious to me.\nRandom walks (not in the probability theory type of way): Richmond Park -\u0026gt; Richmond Hill -\u0026gt; Richmond Hill Bakery (great to sit outside and watch) Wanted to see deer and then got hungry, so I looked for the closest food place and ended up walking towards Richmond Hill Bakery. I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to pass by Richmond Hill, which has a great view and probably even looks even more beautiful at sunset. I saw the first wagtail of my life walking about outside Richmond Hill Bakery. Some guy asked me to help him watch his bike, so I did (but honestly I\u0026rsquo;d be too slow to chase after anyone if someone actually tried to steal his bike).\nIKEA Madeleine -\u0026gt; IKEA Rivoli I wanted to go find a hanging tray - or as IKEA France calls it, the PÅLYCKE Panier à accrocher (it\u0026rsquo;s very useful!!) for G\u0026rsquo;s kitchen as it has really little storage space, and went to the first IKEA I saw on Google. It was out of stock there, so I decided to check the next IKEA that was in stock and realised it was a 30 minutes\u0026rsquo; walk away. This inadvertently ended up becoming a touristy walk as these two IKEAs are on the two ends of the Jardin des Tuileries. I also came across Koya that does a great set meal with 2 onigiri + a mochi waffle + miso soup.\nWhy I\u0026rsquo;m a Museé Marmottan Monet truther Museé Marmottan Monet is dedicated to Monet, and is way less crowded than the Musée de l\u0026rsquo;Orangerie. Of course you\u0026rsquo;d have to go to the latter if you want to see the gigantic murals of water lilies, but if you\u0026rsquo;ve been there before and want to see something else - give the Marmottan Monet a go. They have a really extensive Monet collection thanks to a donation from Michel Monet and also feature other Impressionists like Berthe Morisot:\nBerthe Morisot, Le Cerisier (Wikimedia)\nPart of the museum experience depends on the crowd. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit hard to enjoy works when there are a lot of people around, but if you go to the Marmottan Monet on a weekday morning as I did, you are guaranteed to have seats to sit down and stare at the lilies.\nLook how empty!\nMonet and late blooming In the basement where the Monet permanent collection is located, there\u0026rsquo;s this huge wall with a timeline of Monet\u0026rsquo;s life. I found this timeline weirdly comforting after reading the parts about his late 20s. Note that Monet was born in 1840.\nWhere this photo starts, Monet is 25. He has a pretty challenging time from 25-30 as he debuts in the Salon (\u0026ldquo;the official, juried art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts\u0026rdquo;1), but ends up having to move back home to live with his family after having financial difficulties and also faces a few rejections by the Salon. Then the Franco-Prussian war breaks out.\nThe Water Lilies series which he is probably best known for was painted from the 1890s onwards. This means he started this series in his 50s (since he was born in 1840). Maybe your best work is ahead of you.\nThe strangeness of rest Being able to rest and see my friends was really valuable, but also leaves me feeling very odd. I find it strange how by an accident of birth, I get to hang out with my friends and live in a place with reasonable healthcare when people are facing genocide.\nThere is a comfort in self-preservation that I can\u0026rsquo;t relax in. Right now I\u0026rsquo;m unemployed, and it\u0026rsquo;s really easy to make excuses about not donating or redistributing my money but it\u0026rsquo;s honestly quite flimsy and I try not to fall back on such things. I used to make excuses about how I can\u0026rsquo;t talk about my personal views because I was afraid of being fired (used to work/intern in academia/government), but that\u0026rsquo;s fallen away now too. I can give my time and money and must continue to do so, especially when states can\u0026rsquo;t be counted on to do the right thing.\nFine Arts Museum of San Francisco, Monet: The Early Years\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://tomoe.asia/posts/weeknote-24/","summary":"Week 24 comprised of many things but mainly the wonders of time with long-distance friends, IKEA hanging trays, quiet museums and watching a bunch of folks play petanque.

You don\u0026rsquo;t even get to choose when the flash fires. It\u0026rsquo;ll fire when it feels like it, and also takes a few seconds to charge between shots. There are no zoom or focusing options. All you really have control over is what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to shoot.\nWhy I think this has a fixed focal length Doing well on people / things close by Based on how the photos turned out, I think this has a fixed focal length that\u0026rsquo;s best for shooting people and things that are fairly close by (e.g. 0.5 metres - 2m).\nThis is a photo of a friend\u0026rsquo;s desk.

The light leak here was pretty serendipitous as I opened the film compartment a few shots in, as I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if the film was even advancing. Then I shut the compartment and continued shooting, and I guess this is where the film was partially exposed and partially intact. :) This was done at a distance of about 1m.\nThis photo was taken about 1.5m away. Things are still quite clear here.\nThis was about 1m away at most, since it was taken across a table.\nNot so clear on landscapes (but this is a matter of personal taste) As we get further, things get dreamier/blurrier.

I wrote this on the class forum after class:\nThe following week, we tried out pair programming and the feedback from the class was much better \u0026ndash; I realised that I should be trying to maximise the amount of time they have to collaborate with others and do coding themselves.\nOur weekly Section ended up being structured like this:\nIntroduction of the problem for the week Breakout rooms for pair programming Code Show \u0026amp; Tell by each pair/group on: Their approach to solving the problem Challenges they faced Any interesting things they came across? Weekly forum posts After each section, I\u0026rsquo;d write down a recap of what we worked on and + responses to questions that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t respond to on the spot in class. Having a record of what we did helped in the following ways:\nStudents who couldn\u0026rsquo;t make it for class that week could still get an idea of what happened, and Students who attended class get to a chance to recap and review, and I get more time to think and respond to questions, as opposed to having to say something on the spot. I also get to highlight some really good observations made by students in class :D Random aside to just talk about some really great questions Teaching is fun because of the questions you get. One really fun one was \u0026ldquo;If we\u0026rsquo;re writing code in Python, then what language is Python written in?\u0026rdquo;. This was something that I didn\u0026rsquo;t really know how to answer on the spot, so I ended up looking into it and responding in the weekly forum post. I got to learn more about language specification vs implementation. The TL;DR of this is that there are multiple implementations of Python, but the one that contains the specification of Python is CPython. Very fun :)\nNorm-setting in class Accessibility Some things that I\u0026rsquo;d do from the start if I did this again:\nStart enabling Closed Captioning by default on Zoom (I realised students were enabling this themselves when I should\u0026rsquo;ve just enabled it by default) Check if there are students who don\u0026rsquo;t have access to a laptop. I had a student who was using a tablet which made it hard to be on a Zoom call and code at the same time, so they were usually assigned to the \u0026ldquo;navigator\u0026rdquo; role in pair programming. The hard problem of coming up with introductions/ice-breakers that don\u0026rsquo;t feel weird It\u0026rsquo;s really hard to think of good ice-breakers. The usual one I had in university as a student at orientation activities was \u0026ldquo;Tell us one fun fact about yourself\u0026rdquo;, which inspired the same kind of mental glitching/short-circuiting that \u0026ldquo;What do you want for your birthday?\u0026rdquo; creates.\nA good ice breaker would ideally give someone a lot of autonomy over what to answer, reveal something about their personality/values, and make as few assumptions as possible.\nAs an illustration by counter-example, here\u0026rsquo;s what I think is a terrible ice-breaker (just for illustration, I hope nobody sincerely ever asks this):\nSo, what does your father do for work?\nWhat I eventually used for introductions was:\nHow should we pronounce your name? What\u0026rsquo;s something that you\u0026rsquo;re proud of yourself for? This ended up being a great icebreaker but the mileage might vary for larger classes (maybe doing this over forum posts would work better instead).\nNormalise making mistakes An important part of teaching is trying to remove the moral element of failure \u0026ndash; where making mistakes seems to involve some kind of judgment that you\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; in some way. As Jake the Dog from Adventure Time says: \u0026ldquo;Sucking at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something\u0026rdquo;.\nI try my best to model treating mistakes with a sense of curiosity. If there\u0026rsquo;s an error, what does it show us? Are there certain things we now know about this bit of code that we didn\u0026rsquo;t notice before? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that nice? I also got to model failing with that first class\u0026rsquo; format, changing formats for the next week and getting the help of the class to give me feedback on which format they liked more (pair programming won by a very far margin).\nChanging the way I talk about myself Code in Place made me stop talking down to myself. I have a tendency to hedge my language a lot and minimize what I do. I say I am just a hobbyist, or I only do very basic things like some web scraping or whatever because I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m skilled, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a CS degree, I\u0026rsquo;m not a professional software engineer blah blah blah.\nI never had a strong wake-up call to change the way that I talk about myself until I started teaching, where I realised \u0026ndash; as a teacher who has had more programming experience than my students, if I talk about myself like this, what am I inviting my students to think about themselves???\nIt\u0026rsquo;s kind of like that therapy thing where you have to take what you say to yourself, and imagine that you\u0026rsquo;re saying it to the 5 year old version of you. Would it be okay?\nNow, even when I\u0026rsquo;m not teaching, I try to focus on introducing myself with what I\u0026rsquo;m learning and what I\u0026rsquo;m curious about, rather than hedging/minimising.\n","permalink":"https://tomoe.asia/posts/my-code-in-place-experience/","summary":"In 2023, I spent 6 weeks leading a section of about 14 people hailing from China, Brazil, Germany, India, Japan (and more countries!) as part of Code in Place, and got to experience the joy of seeing people write their first for-loops :) We met for an hour a week on Zoom, but my personal estimate for how much time I spent on Code in Place including preparation + writing weekly recaps was about 4-5 hours a week (including class time).","title":"What I learned from teaching a section for Code in Place"},{"content":"Double bill this time, because I\u0026rsquo;ve been kind of tardy.\nWeek 17 I took a silversmithing class with my university flatmate and got to interact with flux and solder in a non-electronics-related setting :) It was very calming to just focus on:\nannealing the metal marking out where to cut it sawing it and filing to ensure a smooth join actually joining it by applying flux, and then solder to the joint shaping it into a rounder shape by hammering it on the mandrel grinding the ring down to create a wavy shape polishing it (done!)

This was something that kind of emerged as my informal helpdesk sessions went on \u0026ndash; I wanted to find an immediately useful example to show workers how logging in works, and landed on logging in to the SG Workpass app via Singpass as my example. Logging in with Singpass allows workers to see their Work Permit validity, and also access employment information such as their salary, which can be useful in the future for any salary claims. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s got a different level of tech-savviness. It\u0026rsquo;s quite hard to pin down, but there are some things that become second nature when you\u0026rsquo;ve used enough devices \u0026ndash; like knowing that clicking the bold colour button is usually the way to progress. Some guys can figure out how to navigate the registration interface fairly independently although it\u0026rsquo;s in English, as long as I provide them with the right link for registering an account (which has to be accessed with the browser rather than the Singpass app, since such account services are not available within it).

They\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;optional\u0026rdquo; in a sense that you aren\u0026rsquo;t legally required to use it, but accessing services without it becomes much harder. Alternative means for access to services when you don\u0026rsquo;t have Singpass are not guaranteed. The Singapore Courts has the CJTS Pass which is an alternative for accessing digital services when you\u0026rsquo;re not eligible for Singpass, but the TADM eService for filing a salary claim is gated by Singpass.

Cameras in the junk section are usually untested, but this one happened to be tested! The sticker says that the shutter and flash are working, but the camera has not actually been tested with a roll of film. I tested the camera myself with the batteries I\u0026rsquo;d brought along and confirmed that the sticker was telling the truth.\nBesides the problem with names, film cameras also face a bit of an archival problem \u0026ndash; manuals aren\u0026rsquo;t always available.\nWhenever I can\u0026rsquo;t find manuals for my exact camera model (like the Fuji Super 115), I try to find others that kinda look like it. In this case, the manual for the Konica Z-Up 60 will do. The buttons/interface are arranged the same as the TZ-635, even though the front of the camera looks very different.\nSomeone is selling a printed copy of the manual for USD13.95, but you can get a free online copy if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to look at some Japanese by going on gizport. If you know Korean, you can watch Meracasee\u0026rsquo;s video where they go through the features of this camera.\nThings to note This is a TL;DR of the Japanese Z-Up 60 manual and my own experience.\nThis uses AA batteries Lens: 35mm f/5.8 - 60mm f/9.5 Takes ISO 100-400 film Distance: For regular shooting: 1.60m to infinity (35mm) / 2.40m to infinity (60mm) Flash: 1.00m-2.60m / 1.30m - 2.50m (based on ISO400 colour negative film) Macro (Manual says \u0026ldquo;Close-up\u0026rdquo;): 0.50m - 0.80m / 0.55m - 0.70m Flash is automatic and cannot be turned off unless you set it to Landscape mode Self-timer mode: The timer lasts for 10 seconds. The indicator light will flash for 7 seconds, and then the flash itself will flash for 3 seconds before the shutter is activated.

I nearly walked onto the road because I was trying to get a better look at it. Perhaps \u0026ldquo;coming soon\u0026rdquo; refers to oncoming cars. Autofocus is a hit-or-miss thing. This one didn\u0026rsquo;t focus quite well, but most photos are a hit for me.

If you can’t find manuals for the Fuji, use this Samsung one: https://cameramanuals.org/samsung/samsung_af-slim-zoom-e-s.pdf (Credits to Michael Butkus Jr, who\u0026rsquo;s been archiving camera manuals since 1997 with https://butkus.org/chinon/index.html)\nWhat ever happened? I had thrifted some cameras, and was unable to find any manuals for the Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 115 I got. It has a ton of modes like Fuzzy, Portrait, and something that looked like a self-timer and interval shooting. The problem was that I didn’t actually know how they operated.\nI came across a video by ThisRetroLife saying that the Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 115 is actually a clone of a Samsung Fuzzyzoom 1050 (also known as Zoom 1050 AF/ Maxima Zoom 105).\nHowever, the Samsung Fuzzyzoom 1050\u0026rsquo;s maximum focal length, at 105mm (see Adam Paul’s review), is 10mm short of the Fuji 115. It\u0026rsquo;s close, but not quite.\nI ended up looking for Samsung cameras with a focal length of up to 115mm. A rudimentary Google search gave me Shawn Granton’s review of the Samsung Slim Zoom 1150. Delightful! They\u0026rsquo;re truly clones of each other.\nThen, after trying to look up mentions of the Fuji Cardia Super 115 on Reddit, I realised that u/marakh had come to the same conclusion 2 years ago, and I could’ve skipped a lot of this sleuthing if I had scoured Reddit more thoroughly to begin with:\nTypical experience of being online where I think that I\u0026rsquo;ve done something original, then find someone else who\u0026rsquo;s done the same thing years earlier. Tough.\nJust for fun, I decided to try and see if I could find original prices for the Samsung and Fuji. I didn\u0026rsquo;t manage to find one for the Fuji (please let me know if you do), but did manage to find a mention of the Samsung. The Samsung Slim Zoom 1150 used to retail for USD$599 (according to the June 1994 issue of Popular Photography1).\nIt’s quite remarkable how these cameras have depreciated over the years. A Samsung Slim Zoom in Singapore has been sold for SGD65 (listing here). I got the Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 115 for JPY550 (SGD5-ish) in the junk section of a hardware thrift shop in Japan.\nI guess I can’t complain about how point and shoots you can get off the shelf these days like the Kodak M35 feel plasticky and cheap, because they really are cheap (relative to the original cost of the cameras I’m comparing them to).\nWill it shoot? The next thing to figure out is – will the manual for the Samsung Slim Zoom 1150 also work for the Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 115?\nTesting the multi-exposure mode I don’t have a Samsung Slim Zoom 1150 to conduct a point-by-point comparison, but the Samsung manual seems to hold up in relation to the multi-exposure mode. I found multi-exposure to be the mode that’s easiest to test – I don’t know how to assess if Fuzzy or Portrait work the way they’re supposed to, and I’m too stingy to test Interval and Continuous shooting.\nThe manual at page 23 states that you’re not restricted to double exposure – you can do as many exposures as you like, as long as you set the mode to multi-exposure again after each shot. This is a feature I wouldn’t have ever deduced independently.\nI set multi-exposure 3 times for a total of 4 exposures, but I don’t think the final one showed up properly. However, you can still discern at least 3 exposures – (1) a shot of the ceiling, (2) a bulletin board with a note pinned on it, and (3) a cupboard with a jug.\nAt least 3 exposures\nA good old double exposure, featuring Sroyon/@midtonegrey (you should read his articles on 35mmc and Casual Photophile)2\nOther photos Sometimes I wonder how much I should write with future people in mind \u0026ndash; like stating more details about time and place in my photos, in case there\u0026rsquo;s some kid from the future who needs to do a history project about wayward, bumbling 20-somethings living in Singapore in the 2020s. But I digress.\nThese were taken sometime in July 2023 with Kodak ColorPlus 200.

I hope this helps someone who\u0026rsquo;s thinking about going back to school too :^)\nBrief overview of the NUS GC-CF 1 This is a part-time programme that\u0026rsquo;s targeted at people who don\u0026rsquo;t have a formal undergraduate background in Computer Science (CS for short). It consists of three courses:\nIT5001 (Introductory programming course that everyone must take)\n2 other modules, out of these 3:\nIT5002 Computer Systems and Applications; or\nIT5003 Data Structures and Algorithms; or\nIT5004 Enterprise Systems Architecture Fundamentals\nYou can read more about the NUS GC-CF 1 here: https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/pg/certcf/.\nI started this programme in January 2023, and took 2 courses (IT5001 and IT5003). I plan to take IT5002 in the semester starting August 2023.\nQuick note about taking IT5001 + IT5003 in the same semester IT5001 is a pre-requisite for IT5003. IT5001 happens in the first 7 weeks, then IT5003 happens for the 8 weeks after that. The results for IT5001 are confirmed about 3 weeks into IT5003.\nThis means that there is a risk of failing IT5001, then having to drop out after 3 weeks of IT5003. The exact grades are not released to students, but we were told that if we don\u0026rsquo;t hear from the IT5001 team after our IT5001 final, it means we passed the class overall and could continue with IT5003. This was a risk I chose to take.\nTaking both classes in the same semester also means that exams for IT5001 will overlap with IT5003. There were some weeks where there was class for IT5003 on Wednesday night and Saturday morning, then IT5001 exams in the afternoon / evening (Practical Exam + Final Exam).\nHow much time did it take? A lot. Personal context regarding the time I spent for each class I did not enter the GC-CF I programme as a total beginner. I believe that is the case for most of my GC-CF I classmates, as quite a few of them were already working as software engineers / some sort of technical role. For me, I\u0026rsquo;ve had a bit of experience with Python such that the content in IT5001 felt familiar, besides Object-Oriented Programming + basic search and sorting algorithms, which were new to me. However, I don\u0026rsquo;t think my prior experience did anything for me in IT5003 and IT5002.\nClass contact hours: about 5 hours a week There are 2 sessions per week for the part-time GC-CF I students. This usually happens on a weekday from 6.30pm-8.30pm, and on Saturday from 9am-12pm.\nThe part-time GC-CF I students and Masters of Computing (General Track) [a.k.a MComp] share the same classes with the same module codes. However, the amount of contact hours + syllabus may differ slightly. For IT5001, the MComp students had extra assignments in Java that we part-timers didn\u0026rsquo;t have. For IT5003, there was a Recitation session on Friday afternoons where MComp students could attend, while most of us part-timers were at work.\nIT5001: Software Development Fundamentals (Jan-Mar 2023) Classes (5 hours a week) Wednesday 6.30pm-8.30pm: Lecture\nSaturday\n9am-10am: Lecture\n10am-12pm: Lab\nProf Alan Cheng was our lecturer for this semester. He\u0026rsquo;s very funny and personable, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t expect us to do pre-lecture reading.\nAssessment Weekly Assignments (20%) I found these very manageable \u0026mdash;they should be doable even if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand everything about the syllabus inside-out.\nMidterm (20%) You\u0026rsquo;re allowed an A4 cheatsheet for this exam. It\u0026rsquo;s a smaller version of the final where you\u0026rsquo;ll have an MCQ section and some short-answer questions where you have to fill in blanks, where each blank represents a line of code.\nPractical Exam (20%) This is an exam conducted on campus where you have to solve a few problems within 2 hours. Code has to be submitted via the Coursemology platform, and the catch is that you can only submit (i.e. run tests to check if your code passes) your code 5 times. This was challenging but fun.\nFinal Exam (40%) You\u0026rsquo;re allowed an A4 cheatsheet for this exam.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy this a lot as it seems to test more esoteric knowledge, like what the following resolves to1:\nf = lambda a, b: lambda x: b(b(a)) f('c', lambda a: a * 3)(lambda a: a[:1]) When in reality one would run the code and maybe step through it with a debugger if it\u0026rsquo;s not clear (that\u0026rsquo;s what I did anyway, since I\u0026rsquo;m not good at lambda functions\u0026hellip;) and realise it gives you \u0026lsquo;ccccccccc\u0026rsquo;.\nAnother funny example2:\nprint(5-+-+-+-5) This feels illegal but is actually valid, and evaluates to 10.\nTime spent outside of class (~3 hours a week) I spent about 3 hours outside of class a week (on average) working on the assignments and studying, mostly because Prof Alan\u0026rsquo;s lecture style doesn\u0026rsquo;t require us to do pre-reading + the content was largely familiar except for the stuff at the end about Object-Oriented Programming and Binary Search + Merge Sort.\nSyllabus (I got this from my lecture slide titles) Week 1: Usual intro, course information and what functions are\nWeek 2: Selection and Loops, Variable Scope, Recursion\nWeek 3: Recursion vs Iterations, Debugging, Sequences\nWeek 4: Higher Order Functions, Lists vs Tuples (mutable vs immutable)\nWeek 5: Higher Order Functions with Sequences (i.e. Lists) , File Input/Output, Multi-dimensional Arrays\nWeek 6: Object-Oriented Programming (Multiple-inheritance etc), Image Processing, Searching and Sorting\nWeek 7: Exceptions, Intro to Order of Growth, Memoization\nUnsolicited advice: I spent more time on the module towards the end as I had not worked on my cheatsheet throughout the semester. This was a mistake on my part \u0026mdash;just keep a Word document around, and write down any weird quirky behaviour about Python that you come across. It\u0026rsquo;ll come in useful for your cheatsheet.\nIT5003: Data Structures and Algorithms (Mar-May 2023) Classes (5 hours a week) Wednesday 6.30pm-8.30pm: Lecture\nSaturday\n9-10am: Lecture\n10am-12pm: Lab\nImportant note: This class was taught by Dr Steven Halim, who uses the Flipped Classroom approach. This meant that there was a fair amount of reading to do each week. The readings came in the form of the E-Lecture mode on Visualgo.\nPlease do your readings. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I would\u0026rsquo;ve had a chance of surviving if I went into lectures with 0 context, because he runs lectures assuming that you\u0026rsquo;ve gone through the content and have some basic idea about what\u0026rsquo;s going on, and spends more time focusing on complicated/less intuitive parts.\nTime spent outside of class (~8-15 hours a week) IT5003 took about 3x or 4x the time that IT5001 took me. I attribute this to the content being novel to me, and also the flipped classroom approach meant that there was pre-class prep we needed to do.\nEach week kinda ended up looking like this:\nWednesday lecture + weekly problem set (pset) release\nThursday - Weekends: Pre-reading for class, doing the pset\nMonday to Wednesday: If I didn\u0026rsquo;t manage to do the pset by the weekend, this was a bad crunch time.\nAssessment Weekly Problem Sets (24%) Each problem set consists of 2 problems (A and B). Problem A is easier than Problem B. I would say the time I spent on problem sets was split 25%-75% between Problems A and B.\nThese were done on a platform called Kattis, which I would describe as \u0026ldquo;Leetcode that\u0026rsquo;s mostly used by universities\u0026rdquo;[^3]. The main challenge for this is passing all the test cases, and doing so within the time and memory limits of the automated judge.\nVisuAlgo Quiz 1 (11%) Covered sorting, lists, heaps. This is a quiz on the VisuAlgo platform that\u0026rsquo;s multiple choice / short answer with some other topic-specific tasks, like drawing a graph and whatnot. This quiz is 15 minutes long.\nVisuAlgo Quiz 2 (12%) Covers all topics of IT5003. This comes in the final week of class. This quiz is 15 minutes long.\nFinal Exam (50%) I came out of this feeling very defeated. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I passed (at the time of writing). There\u0026rsquo;s a mix of MCQs, short-answer questions and a final problem-solving part. You can check out a past paper here.\nClass participation (3%)\nSyllabus Official class site is here, with a detailed week-by-week syllabus: https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/it5003.html. There is no point in me repeating it here \u0026mdash;you are better off looking at Dr Steven Halim\u0026rsquo;s site instead. He also has a draft schedule for the semester starting in August 2023: https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/it5003.html#lessonplannew\nUnsolicited Advice/Reflections Block the ranking system on Kattis. Kattis displays rankings for the entire class and shows the first 30-ish who solve the problem set. I used Brave browser\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Block Element\u0026rdquo; feature to prevent me from seeing the little banner at the top of every page which shows your ranking for the current problem sets. There was also a Rankings page, which I generally avoided looking at until after solving the pset. I did this because I realised it made me anxious to see that oh, people have solved this within 2 hours of the pset being released while I\u0026rsquo;m still struggling and failing Test Case 2/45. Perhaps you are more stoic, but this is what worked for me as an anxious person.\nTrain for the VisuAlgo quizzes by doing the Training modules on VisuAlgo. The quizzes have the highest time-to-points ratio. No other part of the assessments will let you get 20-ish% of your grade in 30 minutes (total time for Quiz 1 + Quiz 2). I got blindsided by the weekly assignments because I have this bad habit where I get incredibly hung up on an unsolved problem, when I should\u0026rsquo;ve optimised for spending more time on grinding out practice for the VisuAlgo quizzes instead. Don\u0026rsquo;t make my mistake!\nAccept that the 8 weeks are going to be difficult. This was one of the most challenging classes I\u0026rsquo;ve taken. Besides the content being new, there\u0026rsquo;s a psychological dimension where I had to manage my own feelings about work not only being difficult, but also being in a class where there are people who are miles ahead. The GC-CF I is not a genuine introductory programme where everyone has the same degree of inexperience. It feels more like being in a university language class where people are like, yeah I never studied this but I\u0026rsquo;ve been translating anime subtitles for a few years as a self-taught Japanese speaker. I had classmates who would solve the psets within the same day they came out (if not, within hours), and they did this every week.\nThe trick, I think, is to view this situation with a sense of awe and curiosity rather than turning all these feelings into a way to put yourself down like oh I am terrible and so slow at this, I can\u0026rsquo;t ever get a job as a SWE. Instead I like to think about stuff like: How did they make their code more efficient? How did they think through the problem? How can I do this too?\nThe good part of this being a classroom environment is that you know there is a solution (and other people have found it). This is different from research where one can possibly throw thousands of dollars in grant money and years down the drain to find a solution which may or may not actually exist. It also helps that a lot of people on the class Discord are very helpful and generous with their time. I think all this suffering throughout the course created a sense of camaraderie where we all want to see each other pass test cases on Kattis.\nAt the time of writing (20 May 2023), I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;ve passed IT5003 as we haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten our results. I suspect that even if I have, I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten a C or D or something like that because my VisuAlgo quizzes were pretty mid, and the Final was horrendous for me. But I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely learned a lot, and I\u0026rsquo;m glad that I achieved what I set out to do. Earlier in the semester, Dr Steven gave us a list of things to introduce ourselves with:\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my response from 18 Feb 2023:\nI think I\u0026rsquo;ve done what my past self was hoping to do. I deal with struggling much better now, and also made some memes I was happy with along the way:\nHope this helps, and all the best with the GC-CF 1 if you end up doing it!\n[Update 27 May 2024: I forgot to update about this, but I somehow passed the class]\nIT5002: Computer Systems and Applications (Aug-Dec 2023) I had talked a bit about this class on the Project Intern chat, but here\u0026rsquo;s the full review!\nThis class aims to cover 2 parts: (1) Computer Organisation and (2) Operating Systems. In the NUS CS undergrad curriculum, each part is covered by its own module, namely CS2100 (Computer Organisation) and CS2106 (Intro to Operating Systems). The undergrad equivalents cover these topics in a lot more depth. You can refer to materials for these classes too :D\nThe most useful thing I can contribute would probably be recommendations for external resources, because I spent a lot of time scurrying about online finding alternative things to read.\nCourse outline: According to my notes on Obsidian:\nWeek 1 - Intro\nWeek 2 - Number systems\nWeek 3 - MIPS Instructions I\nWeek 4 - MIPS Instructions II\nWeek 5 - Datapath\nWeek 6 - Control Unit\nWeek 7 - Pipelining and Caching\nWeek 8 - ??? (My notes somehow don\u0026rsquo;t have this LOL)\nWeek 9 - Process Management and Scheduling\nWeek 10 - Scheduling and Inter-process Communication\nWeek 11 - Memory Management \u0026amp; File Systems\nClass hours (4 hours a week) Tuesdays 6.30pm-9.30pm: Lecture Saturday: 1 hour tutorial (timing depends on which group you get assigned to) Time spent outside of class (on average 4-6 hours a week) I had to spend quite a lot of time outside of class catching up because I found it hard to absorb content in 3 hour lectures after work. I spent less time overall on this class compared to IT5003, but it subjectively felt worse because I was just tired and confused after lectures because my attention span is quite short. I spent the bulk of my time outside of class consulting external resources and sometimes rewatching lectures.\nAssessments Tutorials/Labs (5%) We get a weekly tutorial sheet to work on, but I was mostly really confused and not fully caught-up by the time the tutorial rolled around (on the bright side, tutorials were online). I\u0026rsquo;ve got to confess that I was profoundly silent on Zoom. Most of my participation in this module happened on the class Canvas forum where I tried to answer classmates\u0026rsquo; questions closer to finals, which was when things started clicking a bit more for me.\nMid-term (25%) This is heavy on number systems, tracing MIPS instructions and caching stuff. I did horrendous for this, and was relieved to find out that I had only failed the midterm by half a mark. There was something along the lines of \u0026ldquo;how many bytes will you need in total for a 48KB direct-mapped write-through cache (including tag and other bits)\u0026rdquo; and I was just like\u0026hellip; huh ??\nTake-home assignment (15%) The assignment concerns multithreading \u0026amp; multiprocessing in Python (this language choice probably occurs because most of the grad cert is taught in Python). Very doable (even by my standards).\nFinal exam (55%) I found this difficult to complete within the time limit (2 hours?). I didn\u0026rsquo;t finish the paper. I frankly don\u0026rsquo;t remember most of it because I felt really disoriented. There was a question that involved writing down the block numbers that a certain file\u0026rsquo;s inode pointers would point to given that a particular thing has X sectors with Y blocks that are Z MB each or something.\nUnsolicited Advice / Resources I recommend Out of the 3 classes, I referred to external resources the most for this one. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really use the recommended textbook(Computer Organization and Design by Patterson and Hennessy).\nGeneral: Bernard Teo\u0026rsquo;s reference sheets (may the traffic light always be green for you 🫡) CS2100 (Computer Organisation) CS2106 (Intro to Operating Systems) Computer Organisation NUS CS2100\u0026rsquo;s extended notes site MIPS Assembly Language Programming Using QtSpim - Specifically liked this for its explanations for number systems.

I also remarked that it was kind of impressive as I don\u0026rsquo;t think I could\u0026rsquo;ve monetized my personal data like this (to the point of having kombucha on tap, and more lunch options than one could meaningfully try in one meal).\nWhile somewhat funny, it also reflects the way I\u0026rsquo;ve been slowly socialised to think about software as in terms of these things:\nMonetization, MRR, ARR. Users. Maximizing. All-consuming, constantly devouring and growing. Extractive. The half-arsed GDPR compliance consent modals where the option that has the least cookies takes the most clicks to get to. Series whatever funding.\nWhen did things become like this, and when did I start thinking this way about software?\nPart of repairing my relationship with technology and recovering my sense of agency has involved thinking about the joy I felt as a kid online. In my teenage years, I stubbornly believed that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite cut out for computer stuff because I was bad at math (whatever that meant to my younger self). I don\u0026rsquo;t know how I typecast myself that way. It\u0026rsquo;s all quite sad, because my kid self loved learning about customising my Neopets page and fiddling with Tumblr themes. I co-hosted a Facebook group for pen spinning with other kids my age, that ended up growing to include people who actually competed in the United Pen Spinning Board Tournament (sadly the message board no longer exists). At some point, my mother realised I was using Facebook as a kid and decided to block it on our home network. In response to that, I learnt how to use Tor after much googling, and willingly waited 5 minutes for pages to load, just because I really wanted to play Mousehunt (and also because it guaranteed me a failsafe common conversational topic with my classmates). There was a sense of unbridled agency, as a kid growing up online, that I kind of lost along the way.\nAnother part of this repair has involved discovering other people online who embody a sense of play and wonder when it comes to technology. Lately, I came across (we)bsite, which invites people to think about their dreams for the internet. There are opportunities for small, anonymous interactions (seeing others\u0026rsquo; cursors), and enjoying non-intrusive collective online presence. (I\u0026rsquo;ve also just learnt that you can have live cursor chat by pressing \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo;, so I\u0026rsquo;ll try that later at night since most people who\u0026rsquo;ve been on the site seem to be in US time.)\nHere are some of the things I\u0026rsquo;ve stumbled upon and have found restorative and joyful:\n// feral web\n// natto.dev\n// soft networks\n// cursor chat\n// the independent researcher\n// wall of windows\n// society for poetic computation\n// recurse center\nDreaming is a powerful thing. I dream of software that doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to eat the world. I dream of software that can just be enough for me and my community. Software that delights and tends to the better angels of ourselves. I want to make more things to play with even if nobody else uses them, like a little space where you can drag and drop a few things, and a frontend for viewing papers for a conference. Dream a little electric dream for me.\n","permalink":"https://tomoe.asia/posts/2023-03-11-software-that-doesnt-want-to-eat-the-world/","summary":"Recently, I went to my friend\u0026rsquo;s office for lunch and joked that these were \u0026ldquo;reparations for harvesting my personal data since I was 11\u0026rdquo;.

This means that all court judgments and legislation should be free for users to access.\nHere, I\u0026rsquo;m just thinking about access in terms of \u0026ldquo;Can I search, and find the full text of a judgment?\u0026rdquo;.\nFinding judgments in Singapore Supreme Court (Court of Appeal + High Court) Judgments These judgments have the most coverage, and are available through not one, but three sources:\nOfficial Singapore Courts site Singapore Law Watch Lawnet OpenLaw All of the sources cover Supreme Court judgments from 2000 onwards.\nState Courts (District Court + Magistrates\u0026rsquo; Court) Update: This section used to be more dismal, but @hueyy has pointed out that CommonLII has Singapore judgments! They\u0026rsquo;re linked in the section below. Also, CommonLII (along with AustLII, BAILII, HKLII) is a member of the Free Access to Law Movement. Cool :D\nThis is where the bulk of cases are, but coverage for this from the Singapore Courts/Singapore Academy of Law is worse compared to Supreme Court judgments. On the bright side, there\u0026rsquo;s CommonLII.\nLawnet Free Resources - provides judgments released in the past 3 months CommonLII\u0026rsquo;s Singaporean Legal Materials - covers cases from 2006 onwards District Court Magistrates\u0026rsquo; Court Open Government Products\u0026rsquo; OpenDoc opendocsg/opendoc-state-court-judgments LawNet Free Resources\nThere is keyword search functionality that returns a list of results, but without excerpts of where the keywords are found: CommonLII\nSearch functionality is more extensive as they support the following options:\nIts drawback is the same as LawNet\u0026rsquo;s free resource page \u0026ndash; there are no excerpts of the search results. There are percentage similarity rates on the side (e.g. [100%]), but as a user I don\u0026rsquo;t know what it really means.\nHaving an excerpt would help users get an idea of the result\u0026rsquo;s relevance without having to click and open the judgment.\nOGP\u0026rsquo;s OpenDoc\nThe OpenDoc team from Open Government Products has a repo with cases from 2019 onwards. However, they\u0026rsquo;re all in markdown files and the link it used to be hosted at \u0026ndash; https://state-court-judgments.opendoc.sg/ \u0026ndash; is no longer working.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the use case for organizing judgments by recency? It\u0026rsquo;s nice that there\u0026rsquo;s at least a source for State Court judgments, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure of why the resource was designed in this way to limit users to the past 3 months of judgments.\nMy assumption is that people such as litigants-in-person tend to look for cases based on subject matter such as the area of law, specific fact patterns, statutory provisions etc. If this is true, then their ability to find the information they\u0026rsquo;re looking for is stunted by the fact that they are only able to search for cases whose judgments have been reported within the past 3 months at the time of querying.\nAlternatives to search for State Court cases are not great either: Paying for Lawnet, NLB eResources Paying for Lawnet Half an hour of Lawnet under the pay-per-use scheme = 9 Filet-o-Fish meals.1 Pay-per-use is SGD57.53 for the first 30 minutes and SGD8 for every subsequent half an hour.\nI\u0026rsquo;m using the pay-per-use rate as it\u0026rsquo;s the cheapest. Otherwise, the standard monthly subscription is SGD206.92 (~33 FoF meals).\nThis honestly doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound great. Free and open access to law matters because litigants-in-person are already at a disadvantage if their counterparty has counsel \u0026ndash; we don\u0026rsquo;t need to exacerbate this inequality by making them worse-off in terms of access to legal information too. Even out of the litigant-in-person paradigm, I think judgments should be open for public viewing and study as courts are institutions financed by taxpayer money anyway.\nNLB eResources NLB eResources gave me some false hope as their eResources are generally great \u0026ndash; getting Udemy courses for free through nlbsg.udemy.com and having access to JSTOR is fantastic. However, eResource access to Lawnet is another thing altogether.\nAfter logging in with myLibrary ID, navigating to eResources and finding \u0026ldquo;Lawnet\u0026rdquo;, I realised that Lawnet can only be accessed at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library. As NLB points out, it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;limited to 1 user access only\u0026rdquo;.\nThis involves quite a few steps:\nMaking myLibrary ID Logging in with myLibrary account Going to eResources and finding \u0026ldquo;Lawnet\u0026rdquo; Realising that there is no online access from my computer, and that I have to go down in person. Finding library opening times Finding a day and time to go down to the library Finally accessing LawNet (and also praying there isn\u0026rsquo;t already another user there) This access is \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; in the sense that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to pay for it, but comes with a lot of other costs. I had to go through steps (1)-(4) only to find out that there\u0026rsquo;s actually no online access via NLB eResources.\nFree access should also entail removing non-price barriers to access as much as possible. Sometimes, it looks like removing image captchas2.\nSometimes, it looks like not making people physically travel down to access a resource where only one person can access it at a time.\nConclusions? Idk, it\u0026rsquo;d be nice to make LawNet available on a freemium model where basic search functions are free. IndianKanoon does that. The fancier research management stuff + precedent access can be left to law firms to pay for. Or the Courts could even just provide access (with no search functionality) to judgments in machine-readable format so that devs can build tools for it.\nAs of 3 Jan 2023, SAL has reorganised its digital services under a new subsidiary called LawNet Technology Services.

You can check it out at docassemble.tomoe.asia. Do back up your docassemble interviews though, because I might not pay for this Lightsail instance forever. :P\nInstead of setting up a nice sensible local install, I decided that I might as well try to learn how to use AWS before my free AWS credits from one of the JuniorDev meetups expired.\nAs usual, setting things up is never straightforward, but here are the things I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt to pay more attention to (in decreasing order of significance):\n1. Learning how to isolate a problem. I could not, for the life of me, access my server at the start. Nothing was loading when I accessed the address I\u0026rsquo;d mapped to it. Logging is an important part of the troubleshooting process as finding out what exactly is going on helps to locate the problem.\n2. Logs as the first port of call To get some sense of what\u0026rsquo;s going on, referring to Docassemble\u0026rsquo;s documentation helped a lot as it provided advice on troubleshooting through viewing logs\nAfter logging the initialize process, I realised that it could not connect to my AWS S3 endpoint URL.\nThis is where I realised that I had a typo in my env.list file, where I\u0026rsquo;d typed my server region (ap-southeast-1a) instead of my S3 region (ap-southeast-1). Typos have material consequences here, sometimes more so than law.\n3. Solving one problem sometimes means paving the way to find another one. After I fixed my env.list config blunder, I checked the logs and everything seemed to be fine (appropriate processes were running/terminated). However, accessing docassemble.tomoe.asia still wasn\u0026rsquo;t working.\nWhy ?????\nTo locate the (new) problem, I had to recognise that there are at least 2 points of failure:\nThe docassemble instance itself Connecting the docassemble instance to a domain name I realised it was (2) after I successfully accessed the site with my static IP address. I can\u0026rsquo;t remember what exactly I did to fix it though, but I remember it\u0026rsquo;s where the problem was.\n4. Silly mistakes will happen, so just have a good sense of humour about it (but also remember to fix them) After the env.list blunder, something new happened while I was trying to add a HTTPS connection (so I don\u0026rsquo;t look like a scammer when friends try my server and are told that their connection is not secure). I was setting stuff up with Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt, but HTTPS wasn\u0026rsquo;t happening.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no particular method to this, but after staring at the Suffolk LIT guide, I realised that I had accidentally skipped a step in enabling HTTPS connections for my IPv4 Firewall. 🤡\nSometimes, trying to do things while my eyes are dry and tired means that I skip crucial steps. I will try not to deploy things at 2 in the morning and instead learn to stop, and carry on the next day. I have to accept that I cannot solve every problem I face in one sitting. This will become more true as the size and complexity of problems I face increases. If I can solve every problem in one sitting, it means that I\u0026rsquo;m probably not pushing my limits in terms of seeking out harder problems to solve.\n","permalink":"https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-12-19-day-57/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been coding in the intervening month (mostly working on a pinhole camera construction calculator for a friend), but definitely haven\u0026rsquo;t been diligent about documenting it.\nTL;DR I set up a Docassemble instance using the Suffolk LIT Lab Legal Tech Class textbook (written by Quinten Steenhuis \u0026amp; other contributors), with AWS Lightsail and S3.

I\u0026rsquo;ll have to look into the useState API to figure this out.\n(2) Making the header sticky\nThis was less straightforward than I thought it would be. Making the header itself sticky was relatively simple as the position property has a sticky attribute. However, a new problem arose where I realised that the Filter section is inside a container (CardContainer.js). I put the cards and filter in the same file as it\u0026rsquo;s easy to setState for search and filtering. However, I now need to make the Filter section its own component, so that I can add it to the header instead, such that the filter section persists while people are scrolling.\nCurrently, the filter section behaves like this, which is ugly and also not user-friendly:\nI find my understanding of React very rudimentary \u0026ndash; I know enough about it to get things to work, but I\u0026rsquo;m not at the level where I understand all the different approaches to managing State and what exactly the best practices are.

This is something I don\u0026rsquo;t entirely understand 1, but I resolved this issue by getting items from localStorage within the useEffect() hook thanks to this article: How to Use localStorage with React Hooks to Set and Get Items.\nUpdating saved papers from the individual card components\nMy web app has 2 main components when it comes to showing cards (containing details about papers):\nCardContainer.js (Parent) | |- Card.js (Child) CardContainer contains the array of papers from EMNLP\u0026rsquo;s Excel sheet, and maps each of these papers to a corresponding Card component. It also contains the array of papers that have been saved in localStorage.\nHowever, the act of \u0026ldquo;saving\u0026rdquo; occurs when one clicks on the \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; button in a Card component. Then, how do I update CardContainer\u0026rsquo;s (parent) state from the Card (child) component?\nAfter checking out bobbyhadz\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;How to pass a Function as props in React\u0026rdquo;, I passed my CardContainer\u0026rsquo;s setSaved() function as a prop into the Card component:\nCardContainer:\nconst [savedPapers, setSaved] = useState([]) ... papers.map(paper =\u0026gt; (\u0026lt;Card paper={paper} setSaved={setSaved}/\u0026gt; Card:\nconst Card = ({paper, setSaved}) =\u0026gt; { ... function savePaper(){ setSaved(items =\u0026gt; [...items, paper]) } return ( \u0026lt;\u0026gt; {paper \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \u0026lt;div className={styles.card}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button onClick={savePaper}\u0026gt;Save\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; } I used a spread operator to create a copy of the existing array into a new array where I can add other elements. This works, but I wonder if I should just try passing the entire \u0026ldquo;Saved\u0026rdquo; array as a prop and then .push() to it. I used this current solution as I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like adding another prop, but that\u0026rsquo;s not really a technically informed choice\u0026hellip;\nProgress/Reflections:\nPapers can now be saved, but the UI isn\u0026rsquo;t very user-friendly at the moment as there\u0026rsquo;s no feedback on when you\u0026rsquo;re viewing the Saved papers or just browsing the original array of papers. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to deactivate the \u0026ldquo;saved\u0026rdquo; view by clicking \u0026ldquo;View Saved\u0026rdquo; again, but it\u0026rsquo;s not intuitive \u0026ndash; I know how to use this because I wrote it, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;d be friendly for people who are using it for the first time.\nI might want to change the \u0026ldquo;View Saved\u0026rdquo; button\u0026rsquo;s text to \u0026ldquo;Return to Browsing\u0026rdquo; when Saved Papers are being shown. There is also no validation for duplicate saved papers, so it is possible to show multiples of the same paper in the Saved Papers view by clicking one paper\u0026rsquo;s Save button several times. I should implement validation next.\nAlso, I think I should use modals for showing abstracts instead of replacing the cards\u0026rsquo; contents on click \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s not a nice viewing experience on desktop (with 2 columns) and isn\u0026rsquo;t a good utilisation of space as the paper\u0026rsquo;s abstract is contained within the column that the card is in.

They mostly relate to thinking about labour, time and everyday decision-making.\nWork is infinite but it\u0026rsquo;s not a bad thing Many people seem to think the \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; state of being, the \u0026lsquo;ground\u0026rsquo; state, is a relaxed state, a state with lots of rest and very little action. Because they think the ground state is the relaxed state, they act like maintaining any other state requires effort, requires suffering.\nThis is a failure mode that I used to fall into pretty regularly. I would model my work as a finite stream of tasks that needed doing. I\u0026rsquo;d think \u0026ldquo;once I\u0026rsquo;ve done the laundry and bought new shoes and finished the grocery shopping and fixed the bugs in my code and finished the big refactor, everything will be in order, and I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to rest.\u0026rdquo; And in that state of mind, every new email that hit my inbox, every new bug discovered in my code, every tool of mine that wore down and needed repair, would deal me damage.\nI was modeling my work as finite, with the rest state being the state where all tasks were completed, and so every new task would push me further from that precious rest state and wear me down.\nBut the work that needs to be done is not a finite list of tasks, it is a neverending stream. Clothes are always getting worn down, food is always getting eaten, code is always in motion. The goal is not to finish all the work before you; for that is impossible. The goal is simply to move through the work. Instead of struggling to reach the end of the stream, simply focus on moving along it.\n\u0026ndash; Nate Soares, Rest in Motion\nThe magical property of work is that there is always more of it. It\u0026rsquo;s there when you sleep, and it\u0026rsquo;s there when you wake up. Go to sleep and stop punishing yourself. Resting is part of the work.\nProblems don\u0026rsquo;t have to be technically challenging for them to be worthwhile \u0026ldquo;Difficult\u0026rdquo; tends to equate to \u0026ldquo;prestigious\u0026rdquo; in school because it\u0026rsquo;s used as a proxy for your ability to suffer and also deal with technically hard things. But as Ben Kuhn points out in \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t need to work on hard problems\u0026rdquo;:\nSchool is a closed-world domain—you are solving crisply-defined puzzles (multiply these two numbers, implement this algorithm, write a book report by this rubric), your solution is evaluated on one dimension (letter grade), and the performance ceiling (an A+) is low. The only form of progression is to take harder courses. If you try to maximize your rewards under this reward function, you’ll end up looking for trickier and trickier puzzles that you can get an A+ on.\nThe real world is the polar opposite. You’ll have some ultra-vague end goal, like “help people in sub-Saharan Africa solve their money problems,” based on which you’ll need to prioritize many different sub-problems. A solution’s performance has many different dimensions (speed, reliability, usability, repeatability, cost, …)—you probably don’t even know what all the dimensions are, let alone which are the most important. The range of plausible outcomes covers orders of magnitude and the ceiling is saving billions of lives. The habits you learn by working on problem sets won’t help you here.\nLeaving school presents you with a lot of agency, which is terrifying in its own right. I graduated a few months back and find that I\u0026rsquo;m mainly chewing over (1) What should I be optimizing for? and (2) How do I cultivate my ability to deal with the higher-order question of what problems I should be working on, as opposed to finding ways to work on problems that have already been presented to me? I don\u0026rsquo;t really have great answers for them yet.\nBeing clear on trade-offs Being clear on your motivations\nR.W. Hamming\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;You and your research\u0026rdquo; has a nice heuristic for this:\nWhat are the important problems in your field? What important problems are you working on / might lead to important results? If what you are working on is not important and is not likely to lead to important things, why are you working on them? This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that everything has to be instrumental, just that it\u0026rsquo;s a good exercise to clarify what your motivations for doing different things are. Sometimes the answer is \u0026ldquo;I just find it fun\u0026rdquo; and that\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nPurpose vs curiosity\nThere\u0026rsquo;s this piece by Scott Young (The Power of Curiosity) where he states that actions can mainly be thought of as motivated by 2 things: purpose and curiosity.\nThere are essentially two different modes of thought you can apply when deciding what to do: purpose and curiosity. Acting through purpose means accomplishing a project or task because you have a known outcome. Writing this article is an act of purpose, I want to update my blog with new content, so I’m writing with the intent of finishing an article.\nCuriosity, however, is a more interesting perspective that is often underused. In taking on an activity because of curiosity, you aren’t taking on a task despite an uncertain outcome. You’re taking on a task or project, because the result is uncertain. While acting from purpose comes from the need to achieve something known, curiosity drives us to learn something new.\nThis drove me to think about how much my actions have been skewed towards purpose more than curiosity \u0026ndash; I studied to pass and get my degree, I worked a bunch of jobs to make a living, etc etc. But I hadn\u0026rsquo;t really been deliberately thinking about how to make space for curiosity and play in my life \u0026ndash; things I do just because I like them. Some people thrive off purpose, but I realise I feel better when I\u0026rsquo;ve made space for something curious and playful, because I am the type that can\u0026rsquo;t really be prodded to do things I don\u0026rsquo;t like. I\u0026rsquo;ve realised that when I am forced to do things I dislike, it is bad for me and anyone else involved.\nWhen it comes to programming, I used to have this frame of mind that placed a lot of pressure on myself to come up with something portfolio-worthy, something that would get me a software engineering job and feel like all the uncertainty etc paid off. It\u0026rsquo;s not the best mindset to have, and continuing to place that pressure on myself would\u0026rsquo;ve killed my will to keep making. I realise that there\u0026rsquo;s a tradeoff as my history/experience looks very haphazard (re: my 100 days of code log), but I think giving myself the space to just be curious and sniff about like a dog is better in the long run. Right now, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to optimize for getting a SWE job ASAP because I\u0026rsquo;ve already got a day job in legal research that involves some programming, and have enough time in the evenings and weekends to do random stuff I find fun. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s trying to fiddle with SimplyGo\u0026rsquo;s website to add up my transactions because they won\u0026rsquo;t do that (idk why), sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s fiddling with p5.js to make little circles.\n1\nAs a random aside, things seem to become cool when people are deeply interested in them. It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of commitment and deep attention that craftmanship has that makes it fascinating, more so than the actual subject matter. Am I a serious coffee drinker / have opinions about coffee? No. But will I watch James Hoffman look into Nespresso\u0026rsquo;s patents in his review of the Nespresso Vertuo? Yes.2\nNoting when past beliefs haven\u0026rsquo;t caught up with present reality\nIt takes a while for attitudes to update. One of the big beliefs I have that isn\u0026rsquo;t really reflective of reality is my scarcity mindset. For a while I felt like I had to work a lot to earn money, and it continued to endure even when those circumstances weren\u0026rsquo;t really present anymore. I felt like I didn\u0026rsquo;t really have options, and that scarcity mindset translated to non-monetary opportunities too where I felt like I should just take on whatever I can get. At some point, I started getting multiple things at once, but hadn\u0026rsquo;t let go of that mindset. This led me to overcommit, underdeliver and kind of fail to be selective about the things I was doing.\nWe constantly trade our time for various things like convenience or purpose or maintaining our relationships or saving/making money. It\u0026rsquo;s important to make sure our beliefs about where our time should go are up-to-date.\nI recently had a chat with a friend about him wanting to do a computer vision side project, but needing a better laptop for it. He could save a few hundred dollars if he bought it when he comes to visit Singapore next year, but it\u0026rsquo;d mean delaying that project by about 3 months.\nThe question(s) kinda become:\nIs a few hundred dollars worth 3 months that you could\u0026rsquo;ve spent working on your side project? (Question of personal opinion) In partially deciding the above: Does it take you more than 3 months to make a few hundred dollars? (Factual - answer is no) I often think the same way, so I try to pause whenever I feel seized by this sudden fear and feeling of urgency to save / choose the thing that costs the least and ask myself if it\u0026rsquo;s informed by my current circumstances, or if it\u0026rsquo;s like a reflex that responds to problems that don\u0026rsquo;t exist anymore.\nStuff that I like reading to help with these trade-offs:\nDwarkesh Patel, \u0026ldquo;Examples of barbell strategies\u0026rdquo;\nKatja Grace, \u0026ldquo;How to trade money and time\u0026rdquo;\nMilan Cvitkovic, \u0026ldquo;Things you\u0026rsquo;re allowed to do\u0026rdquo;\nYour time is finite and not all of it is fungible\nOur time is finite. As Death says in Vol. 7 (Brief Lives) of The Sandman: \u0026lsquo;You lived what anybody gets, Bernie. You got a lifetime. No more. No less\u0026rsquo;. I have this Chrome extension called The Last Sunday that counts down how many weeks you have left and displays them whenever you open a new tab, assuming that your lifespan ends at 80. I have 2949 Sundays left at the time of writing.3\nAs much as the fact that time being finite should make us be more selective with how we spend our time, it also shouldn\u0026rsquo;t invite this toxic urge to treat all time as fungible for work \u0026ndash; like oh, I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have taken that nap / gone out with friends / done something fun because I could\u0026rsquo;ve been working or studying or Getting Ahead. When you feel tired or bad about yourself, that time is not realistically free for working.\n\u0026ndash;\nAnyway, that\u0026rsquo;s about it for now.

However, one of the applications featured was a game on Steam that had no native Oculus app to install.\nThis meant that we had to:\nDownload the Oculus app for PC (btw it has no Mac support) Pair the Oculus with the PC via a wired connection (USB-C) or Air Link (wireless, via WiFi) Start the game in Steam and choose \u0026ldquo;Launch with Steam VR\u0026rdquo; And the conference was a hybrid conference, so we also had to:\nFigure out how to stream what was happening on the Oculus to Zoom Why not just connect it with a wired connection? We could\u0026rsquo;ve used a wired connection, but there was a concern about the experience being suboptimal (range of movement being limited by the length of the USB-C cable) and also risking participants tripping over wires.\nProblems with Air Link and knock-on problems with streaming The PC we were using had no WiFi, and Oculus Air Link needs WiFi to work.1\nThe casting feature in Oculus (not in Air Link/wired mode) lets you show what the Oculus user is seeing if you log in on oculus.com/casting on Chromium browsers, when both the browser\u0026rsquo;s device and the Oculus headset are on the same network. This feature is not available if you\u0026rsquo;re connected to a PC, so you need to find some other way to show what\u0026rsquo;s going on.\nFor the conference, we were sharing the screen of a monitor that had 5 different Chrome windows logged on to the headsets\u0026rsquo; accounts. The 6th headset was the one that was linked to a PC, that couldn\u0026rsquo;t be shown with the same method.\nSolution/What We Ended Up Doing: WiFi Adapter + OBS Virtual Camera Acquire WiFi Adapter (We used an Edimax AC1750) Set it up - install driver and whatnot Go to Settings \u0026gt; Network \u0026amp; Internet \u0026gt; Mobile hotspot Turn on Mobile Hotspot Connect your Oculus headset to the PC\u0026rsquo;s hotspot Turn on Airlink -\u0026gt; select your PC from the list of devices -\u0026gt; click Launch Launch your Steam game with Steam VR Use OBS Virtual Camera to do Window Capture of the Steam game\u0026rsquo;s window, then Start Virtual Camera Join Zoom Meeting and change camera output to OBS Camera Oculus Blog, Introducing Oculus Air Link\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-09-23-streaming-from-your-oculus-quest-2-while-using-air-link/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t know why you\u0026rsquo;d want to do this too, or have the same combination of problems.

My tasks can generally be grouped into the following:\nTheme customisation Updating information (like product tags / changing HTML templates for certain pages) Writing tests \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m learning to use UI-licious to automate testing of stores\u0026rsquo; Uis Working with Shopify\u0026rsquo;s third party apps for doing a variety of things, like setting up logic for shipping, build-your-own-box products, etc. I want to spend some time outside of work becoming more familiar with Liquid and the structure of Shopify themes so that I can do more complex customisation work. There\u0026rsquo;s also some really cool-looking stuff like Hydrogen (Shopify\u0026rsquo;s framework for building custom storefronts) that I want to explore. In this vein, I\u0026rsquo;ve signed up for a Udemy course to learn how to make themes (esp learning how to use the Shopify CLI, Liquid, Tailwind and also the JSON templates that themes have).\nSoft skills and learning about my own preferences One thing I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt lately is that I don\u0026rsquo;t really enjoy meetings. I\u0026rsquo;m on a contract to do about 20h of work a week, but find that meetings (standups, client meetings etc) tend to take close to 20% of that time, which is a lot of time to me. Moving forward, I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to not attend client meetings where my presence is just good to have but not actually necessary. However, since I\u0026rsquo;m new, I\u0026rsquo;m going to treat these meetings like part of the necessary learning curve to get to know clients\u0026rsquo; usual pain points and what features they tend to need.\nComing to my own preferences \u0026ndash; I realised that when I look for full-time dev opportuntiies, I\u0026rsquo;d prefer to work on things that have a longer time frame. Ideally, this would be a company where devs build the company\u0026rsquo;s own product as opposed to having to answer to external clients. With agency work, meetings can be last minute as unexpected problems crop up (e.g. client reports that some feature of their site is down and it\u0026rsquo;s an important) quite often. I enjoy more long-term, less urgent work that I can do asynchronously most of the time. I think that\u0026rsquo;s why I liked my undergrad research jobs so much, because it\u0026rsquo;s about chipping away at this One Project until it\u0026rsquo;s done. There also aren\u0026rsquo;t a lot of meetings or last-minute requests.\nSetting boundaries Working as a freelancer for an agency has really tested my ability to set boundaries, mostly because I have an overextended sense of responsibility. Like, when someone asks me \u0026ldquo;Can you do this by tomorrow\u0026rdquo;, I think of it as \u0026ldquo;Can I do this if I stay up late\u0026rdquo; and tend to say yes if I think it is physically possible to do it, and not so much of whether I should be exerting myself to that point where I\u0026rsquo;m up till 1 working on something.\nThis is an issue to do with setting boundaries, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s time for me to properly set some. I will keep myself available in the day for work, but won\u0026rsquo;t do it after 5pm because I\u0026rsquo;ve got other parts of my life to tend to. If I keep responding to people\u0026rsquo;s requests whenever they come in, it means I\u0026rsquo;m living a lot less of my life. My contract is for 4 hours a day, but quite a lot of time goes to things outside of dev work like doing time tracking, responding to colleagues etc, client meetings that aren\u0026rsquo;t always billable.\nThese boundaries are important because I realised that I\u0026rsquo;ve not been focusing much on my own learning and growth for things outside of stuff related to my paid work \u0026ndash; e.g. learning data structures and algorithms, learning more about backend.\nRandom update: some free camp I signed up for this -redacted tech company - Youth Camp thing that involves 2-3h classes every weekday from last Wednesday to this Friday (run by SWEs from that company), but am realising that it\u0026rsquo;s not for me. 2-3h hours every weekday on top of work is making me way more tired than I expected. I also don\u0026rsquo;t fare well with long lectures. I\u0026rsquo;ll look for this sort of thing and vet the opportunities I want to sign up for more judiciously in the future.\n","permalink":"https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-10-day-6/","summary":"\u003cp\u003efrom May 6 - May 10 just a lot of Shopify stuff\u003c/p\u003e","title":"day 6"},{"content":"Falling off the face of the earth; drinking from a firehose.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been more than a week. I\u0026rsquo;m definitely not fantastic at staying updated \u0026ndash; honestly each day is more of \u0026ldquo;a day where I remembered to document what I was doing\u0026rdquo;. I think 100daysofcode is a nice guide and symbol of consistency, but it\u0026rsquo;s not something that I can realistically do. Some days, you just need a clean break from coding. And that\u0026rsquo;s fine.\nDrinking from the firehose But anyway, the past week has felt like a blender. I started working on the frontend for a volunteer project, and had to touch React for the first time (or maybe the 1.5th time). Working with another volunteer (a much more experienced dev who I\u0026rsquo;ve never met and whose actual identity I have no clue of - such is the internet :P) who wrote the backend meant that I had to figure out how to work with Flask (to test locally), and also set up Node. They wanted me to get some experience deploying apps and dealing with real world concerns like load balancing, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t managed to get it up yet\u0026hellip;\nShe\u0026rsquo;s in her freelance era On 4 May, Wednesday, I started my first day of working for a web design + dev agency that focuses on Shopify sites. I\u0026rsquo;ve never touched Shopify in my life (besides checking things out). I\u0026rsquo;m learning to accept the discomfort of starting a new job, learning a whole new set of norms + tech stack for managing work + syntax (Shopify does use Liquid [ok actually they made it], which I have touched a little bit because Jekyll uses it too). I\u0026rsquo;m blundering and hopefully reducing my learning:doing ratio (in favour of spending more time doing) over time. But anyway, it\u0026rsquo;s 4 hours a day and pays me twice as much as any of my law internships ever did (which is more of a testament to how poorly law interns are paid).\nChanging lanes After finishing 4 years of university, picking up this freelance thing felt like the first step in confirming my change of paths. I studied law, but won\u0026rsquo;t be practicing as a lawyer as I genuinely don\u0026rsquo;t think I can hack it. Some people can handle constant stress and 12-hour days, but not me. I\u0026rsquo;ve got other priorities like my health and possible family caregiving stuff.\nIdeally, I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to do dev work that also taps on my legal training \u0026ndash; like building tools for legal ecosystem folks (research, practice managements, blahblah). But for now, I\u0026rsquo;m just going to focus on getting my foot in the door, feeding myself, and learning.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a kind of shame associated with not doing what you were trained for, but it\u0026rsquo;s kind of natural to change. Optimistically viewed, it means that my time in university was genuinely transformative. I\u0026rsquo;m a very different person from my 19 year old self now. The version of me 4 years from now will also probably feel like a whole different person.\n","permalink":"https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-06-day-5/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFalling off the face of the earth; drinking from a firehose.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"day 5???"},{"content":"Not much from me today.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to move away from grinding Hackerrank and devote my time to studying data structures and algorithms by going through an online course before I move to stuff like leetcode/hackerrank.\nAdded buttons to the Blackjack game where players can choose to hit or stand with, instead of typing \u0026ldquo;hit\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;stand\u0026rdquo; into the input bar.\nSmall win of the day: Graduated from the Rocket Academy Basics course today.
