I’m learning to accept the discomfort of starting a new job, learning a whole new set of norms + tech stack for managing work + syntax (Shopify does use Liquid [ok actually they made it], which I have touched a little bit because Jekyll uses it too). I’m blundering and hopefully reducing my learning:doing ratio (in favour of spending more time doing) over time.
