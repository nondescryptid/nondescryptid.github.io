Hi! If you're seeing this you're probably also at Pycon US (or happen to have my site on your RSS feed). 

I'm here for the first time and am excited about checking out sprints and Open Spaces (and some talks along the way). I've got really low energy so if you would like anyone to sit in silence and recharge your social batteries with, I would be 100% down for that. 

I'm headed to SF after this for the first time too, and would love any tips / recommendations on places to visit.  

Have a great time at Pycon!! 

cheers,
Tomoe
