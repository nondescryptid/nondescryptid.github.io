      <h1>day 57 - setting up my own Docassemble instance</h1>
<p class="subtitle">December 19, 2022, Monday</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been coding in the intervening month (mostly working on a pinhole camera construction calculator for a friend), but definitely havenâ€™t been diligent about documenting it.</p>

<p>TL;DR I set up a Docassemble instance using the <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/practical-guide-docassemble/setup-server">Suffolk LIT Lab Legal Tech Class textbook</a> (written by Quinten Steenhuis &amp; other contributors), with AWS Lightsail and S3. You can check it out at <a href="https://docassemble.tomoe.asia">docassemble.tomoe.asia</a>. Do back up your docassemble interviews though, because I might not pay for this Lightsail instance forever. :P</p>

<p>Instead of setting up a nice sensible local install, I decided that I might as well try to learn how to use AWS before my free AWS credits from one of the JuniorDev meetups expired.</p>

<p>As usual, setting things up is never straightforward, but here are the things Iâ€™ve learnt to pay more attention to (in decreasing order of significance):</p>

<h1 id="1-learning-how-to-isolate-a-problem">1. Learning how to isolate a problem.</h1>

<p>I could not, for the life of me, access my server at the start. Nothing was loading when I accessed the address Iâ€™d mapped to it. Logging is an important part of the troubleshooting process as finding out what exactly is going on helps to locate the problem.</p>

<h1 id="2-logs-as-the-first-port-of-call">2. Logs as the first port of call</h1>
<p>To get some sense of whatâ€™s going on, referring to Docassembleâ€™s documentation helped a lot as it provided advice on <a href="https://docassemble.org/docs/docker.html#troubleshooting">troubleshooting through viewing logs</a></p>

<p>After logging the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initialize</code> process, I realised that it could not connect to my AWS S3 endpoint URL.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/debugging-doc-initialize.png" alt="Logs for initialization process" /></p>

<p>This is where I realised that I had a typo in my env.list file, where Iâ€™d typed my server region (ap-southeast-1a) instead of my S3 region (ap-southeast-1). Typos have material consequences here, sometimes more so than law.</p>

<h1 id="3-solving-one-problem-sometimes-means-paving-the-way-to-find-another-one">3. Solving one problem sometimes means paving the way to find another one.</h1>

<p>After I fixed my env.list config blunder, I checked the logs and everything seemed to be fine (appropriate processes were running/terminated). However, accessing docassemble.tomoe.asia still wasnâ€™t working.</p>

<p>Why ?????</p>

<p>To locate the (new) problem, I had to recognise that there are at least 2 points of failure:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The docassemble instance itself</li>
  <li>Connecting the docassemble instance to a domain name</li>
</ol>

<p>I realised it was (2) after I successfully accessed the site with my static IP address. I canâ€™t remember what exactly I did to fix it though, but I remember itâ€™s where the problem was.</p>

<h1 id="4-silly-mistakes-will-happen-so-just-have-a-good-sense-of-humour-about-it-but-also-remember-to-fix-them">4. Silly mistakes will happen, so just have a good sense of humour about it (but also remember to fix them)</h1>

<p>After the env.list blunder, something new happened while I was trying to add a HTTPS connection (so I donâ€™t look like a scammer when friends try my server and are told that their connection is not secure). I was setting stuff up with Letâ€™s Encrypt, but HTTPS wasnâ€™t happening.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s no particular method to this, but after staring at the Suffolk LIT guide, I realised that I had accidentally skipped a step in enabling HTTPS connections for my IPv4 Firewall. ðŸ¤¡</p>

<p>Sometimes, trying to do things while my eyes are dry and tired means that I skip crucial steps. I will try not to deploy things at 2 in the morning and instead learn to stop, and carry on the next day. <strong>I have to accept that I cannot solve every problem I face in one sitting.</strong> This will become more true as the size and complexity of problems I face increases. If I can solve every problem in one sitting, it means that Iâ€™m probably not pushing my limits in terms of seeking out harder problems to solve.</p>
