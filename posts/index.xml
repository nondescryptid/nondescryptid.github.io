<p>This year, instead of having multiple posts for weeknotes, I have decided to make one megapost that I update periodically. The point is to have a record of roughly what I was thinking about in each week / links I liked. Also, one md file is really easy to process if I ever want to do any kind of NLP or glorified regex mumbojumbo on my own writing (e.g. ripping every link I mentioned in 2025 and categorizing it). Also, reading this requires periodically coming back to check on this post like a Tamagotchi, which will hopefully decrease the (already tiny) potential readership of this post, and hence encourage me to censor myself less.</p>

<p>Flabbergasted and deeply upset to learn that trying and facing rejection is actually a skill that needs practice. I tried a whole bunch of new things in 2024, but they didn&rsquo;t involve the potential of rejection or shame. It made it easy to roll up to things like silversmithing workshops or start growing mushrooms out of nowhere, but I hadn&rsquo;t tried much in terms of risking the chance of rejection.</p>
<p>This kind of avoidance is probably why I find the job hunt so difficult, and it&rsquo;s made even harder by the fact that I would like to find a startup to join. This involves having a degree of agency and Teflon-like resistance to rejection that I don&rsquo;t recall having besides that one time in 2018 where I was fuelled by a great deal of delusion. Right now, I spend ages trying to solve data structure and algo problems marked &ldquo;Easy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When I feel silly, I think back to 2018-19 and how brave / borderline delusional I was. Tapping into a sense of unbridled agency, if you will. In that era, I got to work a shift at Native. I mostly remember faithfully cutting lotus leaves into circles - the bar has a sustainable / regional produce sort of slant, and they were using lotus leaves as coasters as they&rsquo;re hydrophobic. I got to try this out because I randomly sent them an email that basically said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m probably kind of useless but am looking for work and used to work as a waitress at Ce La Vi. Can I come and try it out?&rdquo;. I ended up being bad at it as they didn&rsquo;t call me back for another shift. Looking back, I was probably way too anxious and nervous about work, which probably prompted the bartender who was stuck with managing me to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look, you&rsquo;re scared about only being here for a few hours but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. By the time they step in, the customer&rsquo;s only been here for 30 seconds. You will always be more experienced than they are. You need to chill out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<em>or something along those lines.</em>)</p>
<p>I think about this encounter whenever I have to do something where I feel too new and unqualified (e.g. teaching for Code in Place).</p>
<p>Another time where I felt like I really tried was when I walked in to the law library to ask if they wanted to hire people to shelve books. I had heard through the grapevine that they were paying students $12 an hour to do this, which sounded quite lucrative. She said no &ndash; they had enough help already &ndash; but I could leave my number and she&rsquo;d text me if anything came up.</p>
<p>Whenever people make offers like this, I usually think they&rsquo;re half-joking and won&rsquo;t ever actually contact me. But she did, twice &ndash; once for a summer job at the campus Central Library (which I ended up not doing as I was interning), and another time she didn&rsquo;t even text. She just called me on Whatsapp, then sent me the email of a professor from the public policy faculty. She said he was looking for a Research Assistant (What does he do? <em>I don&rsquo;t know, you have to ask him</em>). I don&rsquo;t know how effective this is as a lead generation tactic, from the professor&rsquo;s point of view. I eventually got the job. To this day I strongly suspect that I was the only person who was aware of it.</p>
<p>I try my best to lean back and lean into that version of me. Something prospecting, curious, unfazed.</p>

<p>Assisted on more repairs with Repair Kopitiam, but these are the ones I worked on myself. I got my first soldering iron from a fellow volunteer at Repair Kopitiam, which lets me work on more repairs at home (as opposed to having to wait for our monthly repair event where I&rsquo;ll have access to tools).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m especially happy with repairs (5) and (6) as they involved childhood toys. After fixing them, I put them up on Carousell. I would&rsquo;ve otherwise been sad, but I&rsquo;m just happy (and a bit sentimental!) that I got to have so much fun with them as a kid. Hope some new kid gets to enjoy these too.</p>
<h1 id="4-movies-watched">4 movies watched</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Last Shadow At First Light</em> - Mihaya Shirata does an alarmingly good Singaporean Chinese accent</li>
<li><em>Didi</em> - Lady Bird, but for Chinese boys growing up in the Bay Area</li>
<li><em>Goodbye, Lenin</em> - The extended Spreewald gherkin bit pays off really well. I also realised that Daniel Brühl was the same age as I am when he filmed this.</li>
<li><em>Pulp Fiction</em> - Everyone gets given grace, not everybody manages to recognise it. Pulp Fiction was screening as it was its 30th anniversary =)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these were caught at <a href="https://theprojector.sg/">The Projector</a> .</p>
<h1 id="4-years-with-my-phone-and-laptop">4 years with my phone and laptop</h1>
<ul>
<li>I got them in 2020. I use an iPhone 11 Pro and a 2020 Intel Macbook Pro (13-inch A2278). Did a battery replacement for both of them with varying success.</li>
<li>Phone battery was replaced at some phone shop at Sim Lim Square and it&rsquo;s started to go binary after 6 months (it&rsquo;s either at 100% or 1%). Now my phone spends hours at 1%, and I&rsquo;m never quite sure of when it&rsquo;s actually going to shut down. My laptop, however, is going alright. I replaced the battery myself after following a guide from iFixit.</li>
<li>I sometimes wonder what it would be like when I finally change my devices. I told myself to hold out and that I could maybe get an M2 or something to experience Apple Silicon, but we&rsquo;re on M4 now and I&rsquo;m still on the same laptop. Perhaps it will feel like entering a whole new world. For now, I&rsquo;m just happy that my devices are still working and I hope we&rsquo;ll make it through 2025.</li>

<p>Listening to playlists is kind of whatever, but having an album that I listen all the way through is a somewhat noteworthy event. This year, it happened thrice.</p>
<h1 id="2-rolls-of-film-shot">2 rolls of film shot</h1>
<ul>
<li>I took the entire year to finish one roll on my Konica TZ635, then took a few months to finish one on the Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 115 MR. I&rsquo;d like to shoot more in the new year.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="1-polish-embassy-event-attended">1 Polish embassy event attended</h1>
<p>In the spirit of &ldquo;you really can just do things&rdquo;, I went to look up the Polish embassy in Singapore in the hopes of learning more about the culture since I have a Polish friend. It turned out that the Embassy had a gingerbread workshop and also a Christmas dinner sharing / tasting, and you could attend by just filling in a Google form.</p>
<p>I spent a while worrying about whether my registration would get rejected until my friend told me about the <a href="https://culture.pl/en/article/why-do-poles-leave-one-chair-empty-on-christmas-eve">custom of leaving an extra seat at the table</a> and that it would be very un-Polish to turn away people who have already filled in the Google Form.</p>
<p>This event was the first time I got to try pierogi ruskie and barszcz — there aren&rsquo;t any Polish restaurants in Singapore. Lots of interesting new flavours as there was also ryba po grecku (Greek-style fish, but it is not Greek in origin), seared sous-vide duck with apple sauce and some croquettes (Polish croquettes resemble spring rolls more than the Japanese potato croquettes I&rsquo;m used to). Loved kompot. Ambivalent about mulled beer.</p>
<h1 id="new-things-i-have-not-counted-in-advance">New things I have not counted in advance</h1>
<p>Some things I tried this year for the first time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Throwing pottery on the wheel (after going to Yingge alone).</li>
<li>Seeing autumn (I&rsquo;ve never had the chance to travel during this time of the year)</li>
<li>Growing mushrooms</li>
<li>Being a NEET</li>
<li>Brewing kombucha</li>
<li>Making a wavy ring in a silversmithing class</li>
<li>Being in a typhoon (Kong Rey/Leon, the largest to hit Taiwan directly in 30 years)</li>
<li>Making a pull request to fix typos in documentation for a testing workshop while stuck indoors because of said typhoon (TDD actually stands for Typhoon-Driven Development)</li>
<li>Descending Gyeongju&rsquo;s Namsan while it&rsquo;s wet and slippery. There was an Alltrails review that I read afterwards that said:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We took a taxi to Namsan Information Center and took the trail to Geumobong. The footing is excellent along this stretch. From there to Yongjangsaji, then to Yongjang village. That stretch had a few difficult spots that would be treacherous if wet. [&hellip;]&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2025 I will be reading Alltrails reviews very carefully <em>before</em> going on a hike.</p>

<p>The exterior condition really isn&rsquo;t the best &ndash; there are lots of scratches and a crack on the viewfinder. I was, however, very surprised by how the photos turned out.</p>
<p>Without further ado - some photos from this camera shot with Fuji C200.</p>

<p>Greens and blues really pop on this. When there&rsquo;s not enough light, shadows appear to have a strong green tint. I&rsquo;m just very surprised by how this performed, considering that I fished these out of the junk section from Hard-Off.</p>
<p>At last, I inch closer towards testing and reviewing all the cameras I&rsquo;ve thrifted, and writing a Grand Unified Post on how to properly shop the junk section at Hard-Off in Japan.</p>

At that point in time, I was still in my tomato obsession phase but found it interesting enough to snap a photo to remember. Lucky are those who live in Sussex.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/shroomposting/allthingsfungi" alt="Poster for All Things Fungi Festival 2024. The flyer lists various activities such as UV night walks. glass blowing, lectures and food trucks."  />
</p>
<p>This got me thinking about whether I could grow my own mushrooms, and how such a process even happens.</p>
<h1 id="brief-fungi-facts">Brief fungi facts</h1>
<p>Mushrooms are just one part of the fungus. They&rsquo;re formed from hyphae (which are small rope-like structures that make up most of fungi). The network of hyphae - the mycelium - grows throughout the soil or whatever substrate they have colonised.</p>
<p>For instance, the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/strange-but-true-largest-organism-is-fungus/">largest organism on Earth is an <em>Armillaria ostoyae</em> that occupies roughly 10 square kilometers.</a></p>
<p>Mushrooms can pop up in the same spot for years as long as the underlying mycelium is sill there.</p>
<h1 id="what-it-means-when-we-get-a-grow-kit">What it means when we get a grow kit</h1>
<p>A grow kit is essentially a block of fully colonised <a href="https://urban-farm-it.com/blogs/mushroom-cultivation/guide-to-mushroom-substrates#:~:text=A%20mushroom%20substrate%20is%20a,require%20to%20grow%20and%20fruit.">substrate</a> that has been taken over by the mycelium and is now ready for fruiting (i.e. growing mushrooms). People who want to get more involved in the mushroom cultivation process may create their own substrates and wait for the mycelium to colonise it.</p>
<p>There are several mushroom grow kit providers in Singapore such as <a href="https://www.bewildersg.com/grow-kits">Bewilder</a>, <a href="https://kinyan.sg/growingkits/">Kin Yan Agrotech</a>, <a href="https://www.fogofungi.com/mushroom-growkitfaqs">Fogo Fungi</a> and <a href="https://justproduce.sg/products/mushroom-grow-kit">Mushroom Kingdom</a>. I decided to get the Kin Yan Pink Oyster kit on Shopee as it was the only kit that appeared to be in stock at the time.</p>
<h1 id="growing-process">Growing process</h1>
<p>It took about 5 days between receiving my kit and harvesting my first flush of mushrooms.</p>
<h2 id="day-0-12-sep-2024">Day 0 (12 Sep 2024)</h2>
<p>The instructions on the kit said to cut an X through the plastic and to spray the block with water 3 times a day (the kit came with a small mister).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1732542832/shroomposting/12_Sep.jpg" alt="Mushroom grow kit with an X slit cut into the plastic to allow mushrooms to grow"  />
</p>
<p>The reason we need to do this is that the Pink Oyster Mushroom (<em>pleurotus djamor</em>) has a <a href="https://urbanfungi.ee/en/products/pink-oyster-liquid-culture-pleurotus-djamor-with-instructions">pinning humidity of 95%</a>.</p>
<p>I also scratched part of the surface with a fork as some websites recommended that for their grow kits, but I didn&rsquo;t really see how it affected mushroom growth at all.</p>
<h2 id="day-3-15-sep-2024">Day 3 (15 Sep 2024)</h2>
<p>Little pins start to appear after what felt like 3 days of pointless misting.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;pinning humidity&rdquo; mentioned earlier refers to the humidity needed to trigger mushroom development. There are some slight differences between mushroom primordia and pins, but they&rsquo;re both stages that occur before the mushroom properly fruits. For more about stages of mushroom growth, check <a href="https://www.mushroom-corner.com/posts/mycelium-pinning#:~:text=The%20Mushroom%20Pinning%20Process%3A%20A%20Visual%20Guide,-Identifying%20Primordia%20and&amp;text=Mycelium%20pinning%2C%20also%20known%20as,mature%20fruiting%20bodies%20or%20mushrooms.">this</a> out.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/shroomposting/15_Sep" alt="Pink oyster mushroom primordia start to appear"  />
</p>
<h2 id="day-4-16-sep-2024">Day 4 (16 Sep 2024)</h2>
<p>They grow up so fast. For oyster mushrooms, these two things matter a lot:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fresh Air Exchange (place your shrooms in a well-ventilated area)</li>
<li>Humidity</li>
</ol>
<p>The humidity needed for fruiting is lower than that of pinning. <em>Pleurotus djamor</em> fruits at around 85-90% humidity.</p>
<p>Due to Singapore&rsquo;s humidity (which hovers around the mid-80s), I got away with being less diligent about misting (I only really misted twice a day). If you are in a less humid area, you may need to create a humidity tent for your mushrooms.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="day-5-17-sep-2024---150g">Day 5 (17 Sep 2024) - 150g</h2>
<p>First harvest! The mushrooms on my kit grew quite unevenly, so I decided to harvest some on this day and some on the next day.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1732542833/shroomposting/17_Sep_morning.jpg" alt="Pink oyster mushrooms growing"  />
</p>
<p>This was what they looked like in the morning on the 17th.</p>

</p>
<p>I harvested my first round around 11pm that night and got 150g of mushrooms.</p>
<p>After harvesting, I put them in a paper bag lined with some paper towels to absorb moisture.</p>
<h2 id="day-6-18-sep-2024---140g">Day 6 (18 Sep 2024) - 140g</h2>
<p>I decided to harvest the rest of the mushrooms a day later, but later regretted that decision.</p>
<p>I got about 140g from this harvest. The mushrooms I harvested a day later were less pink, and had more ruffled gills. They were still edible, but not as tender as the mushrooms I harvested the day before.</p>

<p>For a clearer comparison, I took a photo of them side by side:</p>

<h1 id="keeping-the-grow-kit-going">Keeping the grow kit going</h1>
<p>Each grow kit can yield multiple flushes of mushrooms. The grow kit&rsquo;s instructions said to cut another X on the back of the kit, but I personally found that the mushrooms continued growing along the edges of old growth.</p>
<p>I continued spraying the grow kit to keep it moist.</p>
<h1 id="cooking-the-mushrooms--subsequent-harvests">Cooking the mushrooms + subsequent harvests</h1>
<p>After trying pink oyster mushrooms in tomato hotpot and in stir-fries, my sense is that they are best when fried till crispy with some garlic and butter.</p>

</p>
<p>Pink oyster mushrooms get described as ham/bacon-adjacent. They don&rsquo;t taste exactly like that, but I would say that&rsquo;s the closest flavour that approximates a pink oyster mushroom before you actually try one.</p>
<p>The mushroom yield per flush diminishes over time as the substrate&rsquo;s nutrients get used up. Interestingly, my mushrooms after the first flush were all white instead of pink. I&rsquo;m not sure about what caused the change.</p>
<p>Here are some of the subsequent flushes and the dishes that were made with them.</p>
<h2 id="12-oct-2024---30g-omelette-with-chives-and-mushroom">12 Oct 2024 - 30g, omelette with chives and mushroom</h2>
<p>I gave these to <a href="https://theworldaccordingtosroyon.blogspot.com/">Sroyon</a> and his friend (packaged in an old yogurt container).</p>

</p>
<p>They turned it an omelette with chives and mushroom that was part of a very tasty lunch spread =)</p>

<h2 id="9-nov-2024---10g-mushroom-palak-paneer">9 Nov 2024 - 10g, mushroom palak paneer</h2>
<p>The final round was quite sad. I went to my friend&rsquo;s place to learn how to make daal and palak paneer, but didn&rsquo;t have enough mushrooms for them to constitute their own dish.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/shroomposting/8_Nov_10g" alt="A very sad 10 grams of mushrooms"  />
</p>
<p>We ended up tearing the mushrooms into shreds, and threw them into the palak paneer to cook. This ended up being surprisingly good as the mushrooms soaked up the flavour of the sauce while remaining somewhat toothsome and chewy.</p>

</p>
<p>Our meal :D</p>
<h1 id="what-ive-done-with-my-used-up-grow-kit">What I&rsquo;ve done with my used-up grow kit</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve crumbled up part of my mushroom kit to mix into soil as mushroom compost can <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/soil-composts-mulches/compost">improve moisture retention</a> - but be careful to avoid using it on acid-loving plants as mushroom compost is slightly alkaline.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also crumbled up part of the kit to mix with coffee grounds and cardboard to see if it&rsquo;ll continue growing.</p>
<h1 id="was-this-cheaper-than-just-buying-the-same-thing-at-the-supermarket">Was this cheaper than just buying the same thing at the supermarket?</h1>
<p>TL;DR: No.</p>
<p>The kit cost me SGD14.40 (while it was on sale). I got about 330g of mushrooms from September to November. Pink oyster mushrooms from the same farm &ndash; Kin Yan Agrotech &ndash; costs SGD3.34 for 130g. For 330g of mushrooms, it would&rsquo;ve cost me SGD8.47 to buy it from the supermarket.</p>
<p>In that sense, it probably wasn&rsquo;t worth it. However, I&rsquo;d say that the entertainment value of getting to cook some freshly grown mushrooms was worth more than the difference in price. It&rsquo;s also hard to compare mushrooms that I&rsquo;ve just picked off my own kit vs ones that&rsquo;ve been packed and delivered to the supermarket.</p>
<p>(Is this delusional coping? Probably.)</p>

But I&rsquo;m back and that&rsquo;s what matters (!!)</p>
<p>Would describe the past few weeks as walking a lot, seeing Canadian Geese in real life and embarking on a bunch of experiments.</p>
<p>Semi-failed experiments:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://tomoe.asia/posts/postmarketos-on-samsung-galaxy-S2-2024/">My abortive attempt at getting WiFi to work on my Samsung Galaxy S II with postmarketOS</a>
<ol>
<li>The real treasure was all the people I met online along the way</li>
<li>Being quietly right is satisfying but being loudly wrong might be even better. When I am loudly wrong on the Internet, I learn something new. Someone more experienced descends from the heavens over the wire and tells me what is wrong.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Trying to help a worker with going to the Small Claims Tribunal to get money back from a dodgy agency. It&rsquo;s been 6 months and I think I&rsquo;ve hit kind of a dead end with what to do next.
<ol>
<li>The problem with small claims is that even if you get an order in your favour, you might no actually be able to enforce it. Even if you cough up all the time and money needed to engage in enforcement procedures, the other party may not actually pay you anyway. It&rsquo;s bizarre and I think it only works for people who are conflict-averse. Companies that are truly committed to not paying up will simply continue to dodge and ignore as much as they can.</li>
<li>Minor win: Helping him actually get his day in court, because it otherwise would&rsquo;ve been impossible as (1) interpreters are not provided for certain languages and (2) he doesn&rsquo;t have a laptop or the ability to navigate the court system&rsquo;s interface</li>
<li>Minor win: I have a better understanding of the court&rsquo;s online system and have comments on how it could be better (haven&rsquo;t written this post yet but it&rsquo;s mostly (1) please have notifiations for system events like when the tribunal uploads documents / fixes appointments, and (2) please keep the court website updated with the right forms)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Pending experiments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Powering a Raspberry Pi 3 (from a friend) with solar power
<ol>
<li>I secured the solar panel, but the forecast is cloudy and I&rsquo;ll be away for the next few weeks. I have abandoned the Samsung phone for now, but I was eating dinner with my friend and he said that he has an RPi3 lying around that he doesn&rsquo;t use.</li>
<li>I got a solar panel from some guy on Carousell who said he ordered a whole bunch for his kid&rsquo;s school project but they didn&rsquo;t end up needing all of them.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Growing a tomato - my pirated supermarket tomato has grown up and <a href="https://kopiti.am/@nondescryptid/113224669134714986">started flowering</a>. There is the tiniest hint of a tomato growing, but it&rsquo;s so hard to see that I won&rsquo;t put a photo here as it&rsquo;s kind of embarrassing (though I&rsquo;ve been sending it to my friends on chats, like a fussy parent)</li>
</ol>
<p>Successful experiment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Growing my first round of pink oyster mushrooms from a grow kit, and also getting a very modest second flush. There&rsquo;s some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungiculture#Six_phases_of_mushroom_cultivation">pinning</a> now and I&rsquo;ll see if we can get a third flush. I&rsquo;ve been weighing each round of mushrooms I pick to roughly approximate the <a href="https://learn.freshcap.com/growing/mushroom-yield-and-biological-efficiency/">Biological Efficiency</a> of this mushroom grow kit I&rsquo;m using.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m still very scared of job hunting and don&rsquo;t really know how to feel about possibly asking friends for help. I get this ick about referrals/asking friends as I believe that I need to somehow &ldquo;make it&rdquo; on my own to be &ldquo;deserving&rdquo; but my friend was like, &ldquo;this is not how it works&rdquo; and &ldquo;if we&rsquo;re your friends then why wouldn&rsquo;t we want to help you???&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On the bright side I am getting better at trying and failing, and also treating my site more like a scrapbook (as I set out to do a while back).</p>

I was inspired by <a href="https://compost.party">compost.party</a> &ndash; a very cool server running off a Xiaomi Poco F1 using postmarketOS and a solar panel for charging.</p>
<p>The physical nature of computing is usually not a concern, as things are sufficiently abstracted for me to not have to care too much about it. But trying to revive this phone from 2011 was a reminder that when we talk about compute, we are ultimately dealing with physical resources &ndash; tiny towns with blocks of silicon, lithium, etc etc.</p>
<p>This post will also talk more about the tools I found helpful in troubleshooting - I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with things like <code>dmesg</code>, <code>logread</code>, <code>rfkill</code>, <code>ip</code>, <code>iw</code> or <code>grep</code> before this, but this gave me a lot of practice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ended up killing this project (for now) because of issues with sourcing batteries (more on this later) and my lack of expertise in debugging problems with kernels and firmware, so this is sort of a journal entry/obituary for my i9100 and everything it&rsquo;s gone through so far.</p>
<h1 id="installing-postmarketos-pmos">Installing postmarketOS (pmOS)</h1>
<p>pmOS can be installed with a tool called <code>pmbootstrap</code> or via a pre-built image for your device (<a href="https://postmarketos.org/install/">check if your device is on the list</a>).</p>
<h2 id="things-to-note-when-using-pmbootstrap-for-the-i9100">Things to note when using <code>pmbootstrap</code> for the i9100</h2>
<ol>
<li>There is no pre-built image for the I9100, so you&rsquo;ll need to create the image and install it with <code>pmbootstrap</code> (postmarketOS build tool).</li>
<li>This requires an unlocked bootloader, but the I9100 bootloader is already unlocked so you don&rsquo;t need to do anything on your part.</li>
<li>You will need Linux to use <code>pmbootstrap</code>. Fortunately, I&rsquo;ve got an old Macbook Pro (A1278) running Ubuntu 22.04.</li>
<li>You should use v3 of <code>pmbootstrap</code> for the i9100. The wiki page for installation will encourage you to use the stable release, but you should ignore it. There is an issue (<a href="https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/issues/2735">&ldquo;i9100 Flashing mainline kernel fails with missing vmlinuz-dtb&rdquo;</a>) with previous versions of <code>pmbootstrap</code> that affects the i9100 and a few other phones that use a method of flashing called <code>iso-rec</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="installing-pmbootstrap-from-git">Installing <code>pmbootstrap</code> from <code>git</code></h2>
<p>Follow the instructions <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Pmbootstrap#From_git">here</a> for installation via git. Ignore the part where it encourages you to use the stable release. Make sure that when you check <code>pmbootstrap --version</code> that it starts with 3.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-your-os-image-pmbootstrap-init-and-building-the-os-image">Configuring your OS image <code>pmbootstrap init</code> and building the OS image</h2>
<p>Run <code>pmbootstrap init</code>. There will be a series of questions for configuration.</p>
<p>One of the earliest prompts concerns which release channel you want to use.My experience regarding <code>edge</code> vs <code>stable</code> release channels: When configuring your pmOS installation, choosing the <code>edge</code> release channel may result in a lack of wifi scanning functionality. I tried <code>edge</code> on 21 Sep 2024 and it led to my <code>wlan0</code> appearing to be up, but was unable to scan for wifi networks. After trying the latest stable release channel <code>v24.06</code>, I was able to use wifi scanning.</p>
<p>When prompted for <code>vendor</code>, type <code>samsung</code> and when asked for your device&rsquo;s codename, say <code>i9100</code>. You can go with the default options for everything else.</p>
<p>After you&rsquo;re done with configuring, use <code>pmbootstrap install</code>. This will build the image for your phone based on the information you&rsquo;ve provided.</p>
<h2 id="installing-postmarketos-on-your-phone">Installing postmarketOS on your phone</h2>
<p>I won&rsquo;t belabour the point here - refer to <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_SII_(samsung-i9100)/Installation">Instructions from the postmarketOS wiki for the Samsung Galaxy S II</a>.</p>
<p>The phone will reboot in between <code>flash_rootfs</code> and <code>flash_kernel</code>. If it seems to be stuck in a boot loop after <code>flash_rootfs</code>, you can shut it off by just removing the battery and trying to enter ODIN/download mode again to do <code>flash_kernel</code>. After this, you should be able to use postmarketOS.</p>
<h2 id="after-booting-enabling-ssh-and-sharing-internet-with-your-phone-over-usb-since-wifi-doesnt-work-yet">After booting: Enabling SSH and sharing internet with your phone over USB (since WiFi doesn&rsquo;t work yet)</h2>
<p>At this point, WiFi does not work.</p>
<p>To get started, I connected my phone to my laptop with a microUSB cable and connected via <code>ssh</code> so I could at least use the terminal with a proper keyboard (the on-screen keyboard is a bit small).</p>
<p>If you kept the default username (<code>user</code>) in <code>pmbootstrap init</code>, you can connect with <code>ssh user@172.16.42.1</code> and then enter your password.</p>
<h1 id="the-long-drawn-struggle-with-wifi">The long-drawn struggle with WiFi</h1>
<h2 id="debugging-problems-with-wifi">Debugging problems with WiFi</h2>
<p>The strange thing was that the WiFi screen in the Settings app on the phone wouldn&rsquo;t display any networks, but Bluetooth was working. WiFi and Bluetooth functionality are handled by the Broadcom BCM4330 chip.</p>
<p>To get an idea what was going wrong, I tried running <code>dmesg</code>. This helps to review what&rsquo;s happening as the system starts up.</p>
<h3 id="me--my-failed-firmware-load">Me &amp; my failed firmware load</h3>
<p>I ended up finding this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>[   18.099406] brcmfmac mmc2:0001:1: Direct firmware load for brcm/brcmfmac4330-sdio.samsung,i9100.bin failed with error -2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There were a lot of lines and this took a lot of scrolling, but if you&rsquo;re in the future and trying to check if your firmware load failed &ndash; you can try something like <code>dmesg | grep samsung</code> which should narrow down your results compared to looking at the whole of <code>dmesg</code>.</p>
<p>However, this was confusing because I didn&rsquo;t know where exactly the firmware was being loaded from. After some searching, I found that the Linux kernel typically expects firmware to be found in <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/postlfs/firmware.html"><code>/lib/firmware</code></a>. In this case, it was looking for Broadcom firmware in <code>/lib/firmware/brcm</code>.</p>
<p>After visiting that folder and listing its contents (<code>$ ls /lib/firmware/brcm</code>) I realised it was empty, and that the firmware files were actually in <code>/lib/firmware/postmarketos/brcm</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/WiFi">postmarketOS wiki&rsquo;s WiFi page</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Devices with Broadcom WiFi chips usually have the path to the firmware hardcoded in the kernel, mostly to /system/vendor/firmware.</p>
<p>In most cases you should be able to set CONFIG_BCMDHD_FW_PATH and CONFIG_BCMDHD_NVRAM_PATH in the kernel config. In other cases, you need to patch the kernel and change the path to /lib/firmware/postmarketos (see this patch).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone who doesn&rsquo;t know how to configure a kernel, or where to even find the config, or what &ldquo;patch the kernel&rdquo; means&quot; &ndash; I decided to just do the most straightforward thing I could think of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the firmware files from the <code>lib/firmware/postmarketos/brcm</code> directory to the <code>/lib/firmware/brcm</code> directory:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo cp -r /lib/firmware/postmarketos/brcm/* /lib/firmware/brcm/
</span></span></code></pre></div><ol start="2">
<li>Reboot with <code>sudo reboot</code> (though you could do this through the phone&rsquo;s UI too)</li>
</ol>
<p>After doing this, the error message complaining about problems with loading <code>brcm/brcmfmac4330-sdio.samsung,i9100.bin</code> should go away.</p>
<h3 id="doing-various-checks-on-the-wlan0-interface">Doing various checks on the <code>wlan0</code> interface</h3>
<p>After placating the kernel by putting the firmware at the location it was looking for it, I did the following checks:</p>
<h4 id="ip-a"><code>ip a</code></h4>
<p>This is meant to show and list all ip addresses associated on network interfaces. I use it to check if the <code>wlan0</code> interface even exists.</p>

<h4 id="rfkill-list"><code>rfkill list</code></h4>
<p>This helps to check that <code>wlan0</code> is not being blocked by software or hardware.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>samsung-i9100:~$ rfkill list

<h4 id="nmcli-dev-wifi-list"><code>nmcli dev wifi list</code></h4>
<p><code>nmcli</code> is a command line interface for NetworkManager. You can scan for wifi with <code>nmcli dev wifi list</code>. If it&rsquo;s successful, it should show a list of networks near you.</p>
<h4 id="iw-reg-get-and-iw-reg-set"><code>iw reg get</code> and <code>iw reg set</code></h4>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t face an issue with the regulatory region, but if problems still persist even if <code>ip a</code> and <code>rfkill list</code> return happy outputs, you can try checking your regulatory region with <code>iw reg get</code> and <code>iw reg set $COUNTRY_CODE</code>. The <code>$COUNTRY_CODE</code> is the 2 letter country code (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">ISO 3166-1 alpha-2</a>). For instance, changing my regulatory region to Singapore would mean doing <code>iw reg set SG</code>.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-my-laptops-internet-connection-with-the-phone">Sharing my laptop&rsquo;s internet connection with the phone</h2>
<p>Being able to share my laptop&rsquo;s connection with my phone was helpful for experimenting with downloading some packages while troubleshooting. For instance, <code>iw</code> didn&rsquo;t come with the default pmOS (since I did not specify any additional packages to install).</p>
<p>Follow the instructions here: <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/USB_Internet">postmarketOS wiki: USB Internet</a></p>
<p>On the part of my phone, changing the nameserver with <code>echo nameserver 1.1.1.1 &gt; /etc/resolv.conf</code> as suggested on the wiki didn&rsquo;t work even when I ran it with <code>sudo</code> as it kept saying I didn&rsquo;t have permission to do that. However, using <code>sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf</code> and editing the file to change <code>nameserver</code> to <code>nameserver 8.8.8.8</code> worked.</p>
<p>After that I tested my connection with <code>ping</code>.</p>
<h2 id="after-all-that-my-i9100-only-connects-to-my-iphones-hotspot-and-refuses-to-connect-to-anything-else">After all that, my i9100 only connects to my iPhone&rsquo;s hotspot and refuses to connect to anything else.</h2>
<p>Somehow, I&rsquo;m able to connect to my iPhone&rsquo;s hotspot while connecting to my home&rsquo;s 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks which both use WPA2-AES has been a largely fruitless endeavour. I even tried various public WiFi networks by standing around outside Burger King and around various malls to no avail.</p>
<p>When I try to connect to my home wifi with <code>wpa_supplicant</code>, I get all these complaints:</p>

</code></pre><p>I don&rsquo;t even know where to start with debugging this.</p>
<p>When I tried <code>NetworkManager</code>, it&rsquo;d constantly say <code>Connection activation failed: (7) Secrets were required, but not provided</code> even though my password was correct. I thought there were no secrets between me and my Nokia Beacon 1, but I suppose it begs to differ. I tried every fix I could find regarding this issue. I even tried changing the channels that my network used to match my iPhone hotspot in some kind of desperate last-ditch attempt to make things right.</p>
<p>(For checkling logs from these services, I used <code>logread</code>)</p>
<p>Despite all my half-baked attempts to fix this problem, my phone still has only ever connected on one network &ndash; my iPhone hotspot. Some kind of strange, forbidden electronic monogamy between my Samsung Galaxy and iPhone. I declare them husband and WiFi.</p>

</p>
<p>My WiFi doesn&rsquo;t work because there are ghosts in the machine and love in the air.</p>
<h1 id="power-struggle-it-could-be-the-battery-or-perhaps-the-charging-port-or-both">Power struggle (it could be the battery, or perhaps the charging port, or both)</h1>
<p>I started having problems where I&rsquo;d plug my charger in, then the phone would light up with an empty battery sign, and then go back to black. This would continue even as I left it plugged in for hours.</p>
<p>I got a new battery at a shop at Sim Lim Square (Unicell on the 2nd floor) which worked for about a week, before it started having this problem too. I decided to try measuring the voltage on the battery and it came up to about 2.6V after 5 hours of charging.</p>
<p>After leaving it overnight, I measured the voltage the next day and it came up to&hellip; 0.004V.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1727374392/pmOS/photo_2024-09-27_02-12-56.jpg" alt="Multimeter reading showing a samsung galaxy s2 battery measuring 0.004v"  />
</p>
<p><em>We&rsquo;re totally back together</em></p>
<p>Unicell gave me a replacement as I brought it back to the store within 30 days, and they verified that it really was unbelievably drained with their own multimeter. This was nice, as I got a bit loopy and started wondering if my multimeter was also broken.</p>
<p><em>We&rsquo;re so over</em></p>
<p>The same problem appeared with the new battery. At this point, I feel like I&rsquo;ve tried all I can think of and can&rsquo;t seem to surmount the problems with powering this device and also getting it to connect to my home wifi (much less powering it with solar).</p>

Week 34 felt a lot like receiving tons of tiny paper cuts.</p>
<h1 id="the-elusive-form-99-for-applying-for-a-community-courts-and-tribunals-friend">The Elusive Form 99 for applying for a Community Courts and Tribunals Friend</h1>
<p>For the small claims case I&rsquo;m assisting on, I needed to find a form for one of the volunteer interpreters to sign up as a Community Courts and Tribunals Friend (&ldquo;CCT Friend&rdquo;) in order to allow them to attend consultations/hearings at the Small Claims Tribunal with a worker who speaks Bengali. CCT Friends can provide administrative and emotional support, and also interpret proceedings/documents for parties.</p>
<p>This form to request for a CCT Friend is supposedly called <a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/forms/forms-details/application-for-cct-friend-scheme">Form 99</a> according to the judiciary&rsquo;s website. Sadly, trying to click and follow the link brings one to <a href="https://epd2014-statecourts.judiciary.gov.sg/">the State Courts Practice Directions 2014</a> instead. No Form 99 in sight.</p>
<p>I wrote in to the courts via their feedback form to tell them about this issue, and they replied pretty quickly (in less than a week) that the right form to use is actually this <a href="https://cjts.judiciary.gov.sg/assets/docs/001%20CCTC%20Friend.docx">CCTC Friend Form</a> that&rsquo;s hosted on the Community Justice and Tribunal System (CJTS for short). However, the judiciary.gov.sg site still doesn&rsquo;t link to the right form.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well and good that the State Courts has a <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/artificial-intelligence-court-small-claims-singapore-chatgpt-3801756">memorandum of understanding with Harvey to explore the use of LLMs in helping parties in small claims</a>, but sometimes access to justice involves a lot of other low-hanging fruit, like maintaining website links and making forms easy to find.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d class myself as someone who&rsquo;s quite well-equipped to navigate the court system, but I still find myself frustrated by things like this.</p>

<p>My tomato seedlings are still alive. I&rsquo;m on vacation so I&rsquo;m watching them grow over a free CCTV that I got. I also found out that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/jeeu1s/gardening_tomatoville_has_lots_of_enemies/">two of the most popular tomato forums &ndash; Tomatoville and Tomato Junction &ndash; had some sort of schism</a>.</p>
<p>I finally completed Andrew Ng&rsquo;s introductory Supervised ML: Regression and Classification course. Having to implement cost functions and gradient descent really forced me to learn how to read math notation a little more and understand what&rsquo;s actually going on. I&rsquo;ve concluded that I&rsquo;m really behind on math, so this is probably going to have to be a pretty long (10 years-ish), sustained pursuit. Learning math recreationally is vastly preferable to trying to make it my job. I&rsquo;m also really liking the Grokking Machine Learning book by Luis Serrano.</p>

Little Farms here sells heirloom tomatoes for SGD31.98 per kg, so I refuse to buy tomatoes from them on principle.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m very free, I spent a lot of time this week learning about tomatoes and also started attempting to <a href="https://kopiti.am/@nondescryptid/112978313425047574">pirate a supermarket tomato</a> (&ldquo;Sweet Cherry Tomatoes on Vine&rdquo; by Meadows, which is Cold Storage&rsquo;s house brand). I&rsquo;ll see how that goes. I&rsquo;ve never grown anything edible before, so this will be a first. I&rsquo;m also thinking of growing basil as I read that it&rsquo;s a good companion plant for tomatoes, and also because it&rsquo;d be really cool to make a tomato basil soup from scratch.</p>
<p>Due to space constraints, I&rsquo;ve been looking at dwarf tomatoes (see: <a href="https://victoryseeds.com/collections/dwarf-tomato-project">Dwarf Tomato Project</a>), which grow vertically a lot slower compared to some other varieties that might take a lot of pruning and supporting.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the seeds for dwarf tomatoes grown from the Dwarf Tomato Project are released under the <a href="https://osseeds.org/">Open Source Seed Initiative</a>. The OSSI Pledge is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have the freedom to use these OSSI- Pledged seeds in any way you choose. In return, you pledge not to restrict others’ use of these seeds or their derivatives by patents or other means, and to include this Pledge with any transfer of these seeds or their derivatives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it turns out that they were inspired by the FOSS movement in creating this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Today, only a handful of companies account for most of the world’s commercial breeding and seed sales. Increasingly, patenting and restrictive contracts are used to enhance the power and control of these companies over the seeds and the farmers that feed the world.</p>
<p>Patented and protected seeds cannot be saved, replanted, or shared by farmers and gardeners. And because there is no research exemption for patented material, plant breeders at universities and small seed companies cannot use patented seed to create the new crop varieties that should be the foundation of a just and sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p>Inspired by the free and open source software movement that has provided alternatives to proprietary software, OSSI was created to free the seed – to make sure that the genes in at least some seed can never be locked away from use by intellectual property rights.
'</p>

<p>Perhaps my marinara will someday be open sauce.</p>

<li>Checking the status of a company is free, but information like what their primary &amp; secondary activities are and information regarding company directors will cost SGD5.50 (Sad, perhaps if we had free data like the UK Companies House, <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/director-980-companies-china-business-5-million-launder-money-4003701">that one guy who became a director for 980 companies that had USD5m laundered through them</a> could&rsquo;ve been outed earlier).</li>

<h2 id="when-is-a-licence-needed">When is a licence needed?</h2>
<p>Some companies will choose to report their business activity as &ldquo;management consulting&rdquo;, but still perform certain types of work that would require a employment agency licence. It would be too easy to evade licensing requirements if you could avoid them by just reporting your business as doing something else.</p>
<p>Good thing that the Employment Agencies Act 1958 defines &ldquo;employment agency&rdquo; as
&ldquo;any agency or registry carried on or represented as being or intended to be carried on (whether for the purpose of gain or reward or not) for or in connection with the employment of persons in any capacity, but does not include any registry set up by an employer for the sole purpose of recruiting persons for employment on the employer’s own behalf&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/EAA1958#pr2-">Section 2 of the Employment Agencies Act 1958</a> also defines &ldquo;specified employment work&rdquo; where &ldquo;specified employment agency work” means any of the following work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a)	communication with any applicant for employment for the purpose of processing any application by the applicant for employment;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(b)	collation of the biodata or resume of any applicant for employment for the purpose of helping the applicant establish an employer‑employee relationship;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(c)	submission of any application on behalf of any employer or applicant for employment to the Controller of Work Passes appointed under section 3 of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act 1990, which application is required under that Act;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(d)	facilitation of the placement of any applicant for employment with an employer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doing specified employment agency work will require a licence for both the employee who&rsquo;s doing the work, and also for the company itself.</p>

<h1 id="a-senior-citizen-fan">A senior citizen fan</h1>
<p>A lady brought in a fan and said, &ldquo;This is over 60 years old.&rdquo;
<img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1722835877/weeknote-30/IMG_1551_Large.jpg" alt="Fan with blue blades on a table."  />
</p>
<p>You can also see it in its former advertising glory in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240805053908/https://www.ebay.com.sg/itm/115708535835">this eBay listing for a print ad from 1964</a>, looking very fetching and spinning up a breeze 🌀🌀🌀.</p>
<p>This National-brand fan was manufactured by Matushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd &ndash; or as we know it today, Panasonic<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1722835877/weeknote-30/IMG_1553_Large.jpg" alt="Label showing that a National brand fan was manufactured byMatsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd."  />
</p>
<p>It seemed to have trouble starting up (but would spin after the blades get a little push). When stuff like this happens, it usually means that the capacitor needs to be replaced.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do the capacitor replacement so this is not my repair (someone else did it), but dismantling the fan was a lot of fun because it was just so straightforward. The construction of the fan was also really solid - everything was metal besides the buttons.</p>
<p>They even included a diagram!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1722837478/weeknote-30/fan_diagram.jpg" alt="Diagram of a fan&amp;rsquo;s circuit"  />
</p>
<p>You can get a sense of how dated this is by how the capacitor is referred to as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor#:~:text=The%20term%20condensatore%20was%20used,was%20possible%20with%20an%20isolated">&ldquo;condenser&rdquo;</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>Take a look at the old 1.2µF capacitor and its modern equivalent :) Hope it gets another 60 years of life.</p>

My pothos cuttings took a few weeks to root via water propagation. After that, I tried to move one of the cuttings to soil. This cutting started yellowing and drooping really fast. The &ldquo;soil&rdquo; I was using didn&rsquo;t have good drainage &ndash; it was some soil I had from some tomato gardening kit I got years ago (no tomatoes grew, btw).</p>
<p>I ended up throwing that first cutting away and put transplanting the cuttings to &ldquo;soil&rdquo; on hold. This week, I got this <a href="https://thegreencorner.com.sg/product/naturalgro-super-soilless-veggie-and-ornamental-potting-mix-5l-15l/">soilless potting mix</a> at the Aquatic &amp; Garden Expo. It contains &ldquo;Vermiculite, Peat moss, cocopeat, perlite, Zeolite, Compost, Humic Acid&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t know what counts as soil.</p>
<p>Anyway, I repotted 2 cuttings into this new mix, and look &ndash; one of them has a new leaf that&rsquo;s unfurling. 🌀 I hope they continue to settle in to their new home and grow well.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1721759833/weeknote%2029/IMG_1455_Large.png" alt="Pothos cuttings in a pot with one leaf unfurling"  />
</p>
<p>Also learnt that plants can go into <a href="https://gardeningsg.nparks.gov.sg/page-index/plant-problems/transplanting-shock/">shock</a> after being transplanted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Transplanting shock happens to seedlings and cuttings that have been freshly planted into a new pot, planter bed, or true ground. The change in environment is very stressful for the plant, which causes it to show a number of symptoms that can look very concerning, but will eventually resolve as the plant settles into its new environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, you need to go move to a new environment because you&rsquo;ve outgrown your old one. But moving to the new environment comes with its own kind of shock. Sometimes you&rsquo;re busy trying to grow roots and doing a more hidden kind of work rather than being able to grow something cool that people can see. That&rsquo;s okay and natural.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;d help to treat myself that way too. When a plant&rsquo;s not growing well, my instinct is to ask whether it has the conditions it needs to grow well, rather than asking the plant why it&rsquo;s doing so poorly and whether it should maybe try harder.</p>

This week, please welcome a Macbook battery replacement and a countertop dishwasher leak fix.</p>
<h1 id="macbook-pro-2020---intel-2-thunderbolt-ports-or-the-a2289-for-short">Macbook Pro 2020 - Intel, 2 Thunderbolt Ports (or the A2289 for short)</h1>
<p>I got this laptop around October 2020 with the back-to-school promotion. That was probably also the time where my luck ran out, as Apple launched the M1 Macbooks soon afterwards.</p>
<p>After close to 4 years of being used to make memes, churn out documents, watch Youtube video essays and all types of chronically online behaviour, the battery life reduced to a point that became inconvenient, as I&rsquo;d always have to bring a charger out and pray (in a secular way) that there&rsquo;d be a power outlet available. The final straw came when I saw the &ldquo;Service Recommended&rdquo; indicator appear &ndash; I treated this as an omen that it was time to put this battery to rest.</p>
<p>To DIY, or take it to the Apple store?</p>
<p>Yet another omen arrived in the form of a $300+ quote for replacing the battery, based on Apple&rsquo;s online estimation tool. My personal considerations of being delusional, somewhat frugal and semi-raised on Louis Rossmann Macbook repair videos made DIY a reasonable choice. Your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>I got a battery from <a href="https://www.laptopbattery.com.sg/">https://www.laptopbattery.com.sg/</a> for $57.13. However, I wouldn&rsquo;t actually recommend it as the battery that I got reports a very round number of 5000mAh. A little bit too round. I&rsquo;ll revisit the question of battery-shopping in 4 years&rsquo; time if this laptop is still chugging along.</p>
<h2 id="ifixits-guide-is-useful-but-some-parts-can-be-improved">iFixit&rsquo;s guide is useful, but some parts can be improved</h2>
<p>iFixit has excellent guides that I&rsquo;ve used for other Macbook models and also iPhones. I followed <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Two+Thunderbolt+Ports+2020+Battery+Replacement/143290">the guide for the A2289</a> for the most part. However, there is a better orientation for the Macbook at <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Two+Thunderbolt+Ports+2020+Battery+Replacement/143290#s340788">Step 21</a> when you have to remove the trackpad before removing the batteries.</p>
<p>The iFixit guide shows the following photo for the step where you have to remove the trackpad. The laptop is oriented such that the part with the trackpad is perpendicular to the table/working surface:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/abmUpIlg1JRgBQQ1.full" alt="Hand holding a trackpad that has been partially detached from the Macbook A2289"  />
 <em>Photo uploaded to iFixit by Carsten Frauenheim.</em></p>
<p>The instructions for Step 21 also states the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be sure not to lose the six small washers (two circular and four rectangular) resting on the underside of the trackpad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Orienting it in the manner shown in the photo seems to greatly increase your chances of dropping the washers that lie on the underside of the trackpad.</p>
<p>Keeping the Macbook parallel to the working surface makes trackpad removal easier. I wedged a squishy tube of sunscreen to keep the display and internals separate, unscrewed the trackpad&rsquo;s screws, slowly fed the trackpad cable through the gap and gently lowered the trackpad for removal.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1721064117/weeknote%2028/photo_3_2024-07-16_01-20-59.jpg" alt="Macbook with internals exposed. The Macbook is lying with the logic board side-up."  />
</p>
<p>This repair took about 1h 45m in total, and most of the time was spent trying to remove the adhesives on the old battery. I tried to be civilised and use isopropyl alcohol (I didn&rsquo;t have anything else) but ended up using a very thin nail file as a prying tool to get the batteries off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite happy with the replacement battery (so far) despite its suspicious battery capacity reporting. I can get about 5-6 hours of use before the battery runs out, which is a huge improvement from whatever it was before.</p>
<p>Random aside: I&rsquo;ve noticed that my laptop seems to wheeze a lot less and also doesn&rsquo;t heat up as much as it used to ever since I changed the battery. My laptop&rsquo;s fan used to randomly start whirring even when nothing demanding was happening. It was loud enough that people would comment on it &ndash; something along the lines of &ldquo;Dude, is your laptop okay?&rdquo;. After a while I had a stock response of &ldquo;Yeah, she has asthma.&rdquo; My laptop was also often too hot to actually ever place it on my lap.</p>
<p>Overall: Had a great time testing my own patience and motor skills. I&rsquo;ve done some other repairs for other Macbook models, but those were more recreational as they&rsquo;re old spare laptops. This one had slightly higher stakes as it&rsquo;s the laptop that I use on a daily basis. I&rsquo;m glad it worked out fine. The sad part in all of this was not being able to just purchase an original Apple battery and install it myself.</p>
<h1 id="countertop-dishwasher">Countertop Dishwasher</h1>
<p>My friend&rsquo;s countertop dishwasher started leaking water &ndash; enough to cover the countertop and surrounding floor with water &ndash; but somehow was still able to run. Electronics-wise, everything was okay.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1721064116/weeknote%2028/photo_5_2024-07-16_01-20-59.jpg" alt="Underside of a dishwasher with internals exposed. There is a heating element, an inlet and draining hose, and a small circuit."  />
</p>
<p>We ended up trying to run it, but with the base taken off, so we could see where exactly the leak was coming from. We propped up the dishwasher with 2 chairs. A mop bucket came in handy for catching any leaking water.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1721065742/weeknote%2028/photo_2024-07-16_01-48-47.jpg" alt="Dishwasher propped up with 2 chairs on either side, with a blue mop bucket directly underneath it"  />
</p>
<p>There was only one spot that was leaking as that part of the hose had come loose. We went out in search hose clamps and found them for $1. These are ones you can adjust by turning a key. Very cool =)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1721064116/weeknote%2028/photo_7_2024-07-16_01-20-59.jpg" alt="Closeup of the end of a hose with a hose clamp attached."  />
</p>
<p>Very happy with this too, because it&rsquo;s something that my friend uses 2-3 times a week, so getting this fixed was a Certified Win.</p>
<h1 id="thinking-about-labour">Thinking about labour</h1>
<p>The last time I had a long stretch of time entirely in my control was around 2018. The strange thing is that the Singapore school calendar runs from Jan-Dec for junior college, but Singapore universities adhere to the general August-May/June calendar. This creates an 8 month gap between finishing Singapore&rsquo;s equivalent of high school and starting university.</p>
<p>Times like these tend to involve some kind of new understanding of labour, myself, and negotiating how the way people perceive me changes with it.</p>
<p>Back in 2018, I &ldquo;interned&rdquo; in a Big 4 law firm with a few other people who&rsquo;d also just finished junior college. This is something I never really spoke about. I left it off my CV entirely, because it was a work experience I honestly couldn&rsquo;t really stand by, but I was afraid that ever speaking about my experience would torpedo any chances I had of a legal career. I was a lot younger, more fearful, and also still thought that I&rsquo;d be a lawyer.</p>
<p>We were hoping to get some exposure to law, but what we really ended up doing was working on billing clients. Clients tend to be billed on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Financial years tend to start in April, so the first quarter of the year is spent preparing a lot of timesheets for billing. The department was largely staffed by Malaysian staff whose work was being billed out many times more than they were receiving in salary (Which was a lot lower compared to Singaporeans, because SGD goes really far when converted to MYR).</p>
<p>The partner in charge said something like &ldquo;Do you even know English?&rdquo; to me once in relation to some unbilled time spreadsheet. That wasn&rsquo;t even the thing that upset me the most. I had cultivated the personality of a non-stick pan by that point, and just replied very literally, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll go back to check on [INSERT THING] and follow up with you&rdquo;. What hardened my resolve to quit was this one time where I saw the partner mock a Malaysian full-timer&rsquo;s command of English. English was probably this person&rsquo;s third/fourth language (the first few being Malay, Mandarin and Cantonese). It was especially upsetting because I interacted with this colleague a lot (as a clueless intern), and knew just how many books related to learning English they had at their desk. I could see how hard they were trying, and I was just some random intern who&rsquo;d been there for a month or so.</p>
<p>I quit after 2 months and started waitressing at a club at the top of Marina Bay Sands (let&rsquo;s call it the Ship since it looks like one) instead. I got the job because one of the students in the year above me at school also worked there after graduating. I got paid a lot more in hourly terms &ndash; going from about $3.75 an hour ($600 a month divided by roughly 20 workdays that were 8 hours each - but the rate was probably worse because of all the unpaid overtime we did) to $12 an hour was a big jump to me. The workplace was nice as most people just treated it like a job. By design, you also couldn&rsquo;t take your work home with you. I got to see a lot of things I wouldn&rsquo;t ever have experienced normally. Marina Bay Sands is great for viewing fireworks on National Day as the fireworks stop at roughly the same height as the Ship. I got to try stuff (for free!) that I&rsquo;d never try otherwise (Ruinart/Dom Perignon/Veuve Clicquot, etc etc).</p>
<p>It had its own downsides, though. I find it hard to go to clubs and enjoy it nowadays. But I really enjoyed getting paid. I did a 2 week stint at the Law Society Pro Bono Services centre, but it was an unpaid thing, so I ended up at the Pro Bono Services place from Mon-Fri, then I&rsquo;d work Friday 8pm-5am and Saturday 8pm-5am.</p>
<p>In university, I picked up a bunch of ad-hoc research jobs as working at the club didn&rsquo;t gel with my schedule anymore.</p>
<p>This year is the first time in a very long time (perhaps since I was a kid) where I can just <em>do things I want</em>. I forgot it what it&rsquo;s like to have a life where I&rsquo;m not constantly thinking about how to get money.</p>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve been preparing for for a really, really long time. Ever since I started that club job in 2018, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the day where I could have uninterrupted time to just spend as I wanted to. I contemplated taking a gap year, until my university made me an offer that was too good to refuse.</p>
<p>Status is a very amorphous thing. I can&rsquo;t really understand or participate in status games. For instance, having certain names on your work history are supposed to be &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;prestigious&rdquo;, but as that dreadful pre-university Big 4 law firm experience taught me &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t always mean much. Some people have great branding but display a really special kind of cruelty when they think they can get away with it.</p>
<p>Over the past 5-6 years have really fluctuated in terms of whatever this &ldquo;status&rdquo; thing is:</p>
<ul>
<li>clueless &lsquo;intern&rsquo; in a law firm</li>
<li>club waitress character arc</li>
<li>get a full ride scholarship to university</li>
<li>do poorly for first 2 years in school</li>
<li>advocate for myself well enough despite my dumpster-fire grades so that the scholarship office says &ldquo;ok we&rsquo;ll demote you to some lower tier with less benefits instead&rdquo; instead of kicking me out right away</li>
<li>things improve in year 3/4 as I sort some things out, but still not enough to keep it. get kicked from scholarship (sad, a lot of shame, and a lot of anxiety)</li>
<li>somehow graduate</li>
<li>study while working after graduation (+ points because I&rsquo;m working and studying and am therefore Gainfully Occupied)</li>
<li>intern at government body (- points because I&rsquo;ve chosen to do an internship instead of a full-time permanent/contract position)</li>
<li>now am neither working a job or officially in school. (-100 points).</li>
</ul>
<p>I find it interesting to see how others&rsquo; perceptions of me change, since I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve changed that much in terms of my interests and values. I&rsquo;m still me. One thing that confuses and/or pains me is when I speak to someone and they treat my current situation as a problem that requires solving without appreciating that this is something that I&rsquo;ve wanted for a long while, or being curious about what I&rsquo;m doing outside of trying to suss out what my wage labour situation is (uhhh I did a little bit of freelance work?) or what my next career move is. When things like this happen, I wonder what I looked like to them in the past.</p>

This week I finally got around to making my site-search shortcut CLI tool more usable. I can use a shortcut to search specific sites instead of having to type stuff like <code>site:forums.developer.nvidia.com</code> into the search bar. I haven&rsquo;t touched code in ages, and I&rsquo;m glad to finally be back at it.</p>
<p>I was reading a piece lately about <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/06/29/japan/japan-tourism-focus/">Why it feels like everyone in the world is heading to Japan right now</a> and would like to recommend not going to Tokyo/Osaka/Kyoto (or rather, not staying there for too long).</p>
<p>Instead, if you try some food that you really like, see where it&rsquo;s from and think about whether you&rsquo;d like to visit. This happened because I got some <a href="https://tamayaseimen.co.jp/en/archives/products/gassan-soba-70">soba</a> last year from my grandfather (who lives in Nagoya). He volunteers to walk kids to school, and the parents of one of the kids he walked with gave him this whole load of soba as a gift to celebrate their kid finishing elementary school.</p>
<p>The soba was really good, so I went to look up where it&rsquo;s from: Mt Gassan. Mt Gassan is located in Nishikawa and is part of the &ldquo;Three Holy Mountains of Dewa [&hellip;] situated near the Sea of Japan in Yamagata Prefecture, consisting of Mount Haguro, Mount Gassan and Mount Yudono that represent birth, death and rebirth respectively.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Someone&rsquo;s also got <a href="https://timbunting.com/mountains/gassan/">a really detailed writeup</a> about hiking Mt Gassan.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also lots of good <a href="https://www.gassan-info.com/en/gourmet">produce</a> like wild vegetables and mushrooms. You can even book a <a href="https://www.byfood.com/experiences/mountain-vegetable-foraging-cooking-lesson-320">foraging experience</a> where you learn to identify, forage and cook plants :D Check out the prefecture (Nishikawa is part of Yamagata prefecture) on <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/places/yamagata">iNaturalist</a> too.</p>
<p>Something like this sounds a lot more fun than fighting the crowds in Tokyo/Osaka/Kyoto. There&rsquo;s a certain point where places get a lot less enjoyable because of the sheer population density. E.g.: the <a href="https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/news/kawaguchiko-is-blocking-the-mt-fuji-view-at-this-popular-lawson-store-043024">Mt Fuji view from a popular Lawson minimart getting boarded up</a> to discourage tourists from taking photos as the crowds have gotten so bad that it obstructs pedestrian pathways.</p>
<p>I am now taking recommendations from the backs of other food packages.</p>

<p>You get to choose between a 35mm or 70mm lens with the biaxial system (i.e. no zoom), and there are two separate buttons for flash and continuous/self-timer controls. I take note of this because some cameras have incredibly convoluted steps for disabling flash &ndash; the Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 115 requires you to press the flash button <em>6 times</em> before you can take a photo without flash. The AF-1 Twin is very straightforward in comparison.</p>
<p>I enjoy the mechanism where you slide the lens cover to turn on the camera. As a clumsy person, I think this would survive being thrown into my backpack. Cameras that are powered by buttons sometimes end up turning on while they&rsquo;re in my bag (horror).</p>
<p>The lens cover of the one I got seemed to have a lot of friction, so I pried off the cover, starting from the bottom. The cover clips onto the body of the camera. I kind of expected to face problems like this since it was 550 yen from the junk section.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1719988979/olympus%20af-1%20twin/IMG_4565.jpg" alt="Close-up of a Olympus AF-1 Twin camera. The lens cover has been removed to expose the front of the camera."  />
</p>
<p><em>Before cleaning</em>: Lots of grime. There&rsquo;s a big scratch where the lens cover slides.</p>
<p>After prying it off, I used a toothpick / needle to scrape dirt out from the indented track that the lens cover slides on, and used a cotton tip with some isopropyl alcohol to clean it up.</p>

</p>
<p><em>After cleaning</em>: Much better : )</p>
<p>Taking off the lens cover also gave me the chance to see how the sliding mechanism works &ndash; when sliding, you push on this little latch (not sure what the right term is) that turns the camera on. It&rsquo;s located next to the telephoto lens.</p>
<h1 id="photos">Photos</h1>
<p>Photos here were shot with Kodak Ultramax 400 (I think)</p>
<p>The manual states that the shooting range for the lenses is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wide (35mm): 0.75m to infinity</li>
<li>Tele (70mm): 0.8m to infinity</li>
</ul>

Tele (70mm)</p>
<p>My focus was kind of off in the 70mm photo. This is probably user error on my part. But one thing I&rsquo;ll say is, the Olympus AF-1 Twin really eats landscapes up. All I really needed to do was to point and shoot.</p>

I aspire to be like <a href="https://sometimes.digital/weeknotes/">Nika</a> who (1) has a very snazzy layout for weeknotes that&rsquo;s styled like a calendar and (2) is very consistent. Fingers crossed that I actually do sit down on Sunday nights from now on.</p>
<p>Accompanied someone who was serving as a witness to court (anticlimactic as the fella actually being prosecuted didn&rsquo;t show up and somehow got hospitalised the night before trial). Woke up early enough to go for a walk and see a bunch of shrooms I couldn&rsquo;t ID.</p>

<p>Went for a friend&rsquo;s wedding - this is the first I&rsquo;ve gone for as an adult. Despite my general cynicism, I love witnessing and celebrating other people&rsquo;s love. What a joy : ) Chinese wedding culture really confuses me though. There are even websites to tell you <a href="https://singaporebrides.com/wedding-ang-bao-rates/">what the prevailing ang bao rate is for a banquet dinner based on a wedding venue</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Rice Media has a piece titled &ldquo;<a href="https://www.ricemedia.co/to-hell-with-the-ang-bao-market-rate-guides/">To Hell With Ang Bao Market Rates</a>&rdquo;. The wedding I went for was at a church with lunch afterwards, so I haven&rsquo;t actually encountered a banquet dinner yet. I haven&rsquo;t really figured out what I&rsquo;d say if I can&rsquo;t go for someone&rsquo;s wedding because I can&rsquo;t afford it.</p>
<p>Worked on fixing a dizzying number of fans this week. Each month I try to make it for my neighbourhood&rsquo;s <a href="https://repairkopitiam.sg/">Repair Kopitiam</a>, which is kind of like a repair meetup where people can bring their faulty appliances and you fix them together. This week involved a lot of thermal fuse replacements and opening up the fan&rsquo;s innards to clean and lubricate.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1719916673/weeknote-26/IMG_0822.jpg" alt="Fan with metal shaft exposed"  />

</p>
<p>The funny thing is that opening up a fan to expose the motor&rsquo;s copper coil typically leads to the shaft being slightly misaligned when you secure the covers back on, so we had to whack the shaft (with a screwdriver) until it aligned and started spinning smoothly again&hellip;it&rsquo;s always funny when smacking something fixes it.</p>
<p>We encountered 2 portable blenders that seemed to be &ldquo;broken&rdquo;, but they were actually working - their indicator lights were flashing as the blender bottle/jug wasn&rsquo;t screwed tightly enough to engage the <a href="https://lgswitch.en.made-in-china.com/product/xKiQOpNHhnYw/China-Mini-Micro-Safety-Switch-for-Blender.html">microswitch</a> that&rsquo;s underneath the main body&rsquo;s rubber seal. This prevents the blades from working if the bottle/jug isn&rsquo;t screwed on.</p>

This week covered my final 3 days in London and the long trip home.</p>
<p>I have learnt that getting film hand-inspected when taking the Eurostar (St Pancras or Gare du Nord) or at Heathrow Airport is a real pain because they say it has to go through the machine as long as your film&rsquo;s under ISO 800. Getting hand inspection done in the US or in Japan has been really easy, so I wasn&rsquo;t expecting so much pushback from other airports.</p>
<p>After texting Sroyon (who is a more serious photographer and more updated than I am), he pointed out that Heathrow has 2 types of machines (CT scan machines and X-ray ones). The two types of machines (evil and good) currently coexist because Heathrow hasn&rsquo;t finished replacing all <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-68326068">146 security lanes&rsquo;</a> worth of machines. Thankfully, my film turned out fine and I could actually get the photos from this trip and write my Raynox ME-606 post.</p>
<p>My final 3 days were just spent with friends and walking around a lot. To drive this point home, I had dinner with 2 friends who both live in London but hadn&rsquo;t met each other. This happened after dinner while we were walking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SY: [&hellip;] We went on a walk that passes by about 8 grocery stores and then Tomo said &ldquo;wow, walking is so nice&rdquo; and immediately tripped on flat ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>V: HAHAHAHA I know she really loves walking</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it isn&rsquo;t already abundantly clear &ndash; I love walking.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some photos:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1719851704/weeknote-25/camphoto_684387517.jpg" alt="Close-up shot of someone holding a drink and a green cap that says &amp;ldquo;OFFICIAL DOG WALKER&amp;rdquo; in all caps"  />

Thrifted this from the <a href="https://www.royaltrinityhospice.london/queensway">Queensway outlet of the Royal Trinity Hospice charity shop</a>. It&rsquo;s funny because I don&rsquo;t have a dog. I am the dog and I&rsquo;m walking myself (this would explain why I&rsquo;m very food-motivated and also enjoy walking about).</p>

</p>
<p>Got to see a brat poster in real life. 🫡 (Favourite track off the album is Apple)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1719851707/weeknote-25/camphoto_1903590565.jpg" alt="Chilli con carne baked potato with salad on the side"  />
</p>
<p>The largest baked potato of my life at <a href="https://shepherdessbbq.co.uk/">Shepherdess BBQ Cafe</a>. V was viewing a flat in the area and we decided to get lunch there. I thought this would be somewhat small as £10 doesn&rsquo;t usually go very far in London, but I ended up having to take half of it home as I couldn&rsquo;t finish it (P.S. they pack your to-go stuff really nicely too!).</p>
<p>V is disarmingly friendly and also has this preternatural ability to just start speaking to anybody, anytime.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> While I was washing my hands in the restroom, V found out that the lady who was serving us our food had moved here from Turkey 4 years ago and really loves it &ndash; she said &ldquo;it can be expensive, but if you split it with people it&rsquo;s easy&rdquo; (e.g. rent, or just expenses in general). Then came the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>V: Ok so when are you moving to London?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly would love to, but I need to find a job there first. As someone with no STEM degree who wants to move into software engineering in the year 2024, this feels like trying to get struck by lightning while also winning the lottery. Trying to move countries on top of this is  perhaps a bit much. I don&rsquo;t even want to say what I want out loud, because it might sound delusional / open me up to being laughed at.</p>

</p>
<p>Why do pigons do this even when there&rsquo;s a big open space right next to the bridge? Baffling little guys. Still cute though.</p>

</p>
<p>Mallards (i think) and a coot. I love coots. They look so goofy and the babies have red faces. If you are interested in London wildlife, please check out <a href="https://www.meer.com/en/authors/145-gehan-de-silva-wijeyeratne">Gehan de Silva Wijeyratne&rsquo;s blog</a> (I use full names for people I don&rsquo;t really know personally) - he has a 3-part series of recommendations for where to go. I met him on a walk with the London Bird Club in Week 23 and he gave me a pamphlet for the London Natural History Society.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bit of lore behind the walk. I nearly missed it because my train got delayed and I reached the Baker Street Sherlock Holmes Statue about 10 minutes late. I figured that the worst case was that I&rsquo;d have a nice walk on my own,  so I decided to head to Regent&rsquo;s Park anyway after making a blind guess on what route they&rsquo;d probably take and somehow managed to catch up with them.</p>
<p>If you are ever late for a walk and looking for birders, just look for a group of people where everyone has a pair of binoculars.</p>
<p>I did not have binoculars and ended up taking in everything with my raw, astigmatism-riddled eyes and glasses.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1719854589/weeknote-25/IMG_0672.jpg" alt="Bench with a dedicated inscription that reads: &amp;ldquo;Samuel Jackson Daly. November 35th 1902 - January 41st 2001. Loving acquaintance, committed fan of several sports teams, devoted step brother-in-law and faithful forwarder of memes.&amp;rdquo;"  />
</p>
<p>I really want to know what the lore behind this memorial bench is. Wanted to put it on OpenBenches, but realised <a href="https://openbenches.org/bench/29522">someone had already beaten me to it by a year</a>. Hope Samuel Jackson Daly is having a good giggle wherever they might be.</p>
<p>No photos for the next thing, but I went to see the <a href="https://www.angelcomedy.co.uk/whats-on/">Angel Comedy Club&rsquo;s free shows</a>. Technically free, but more precisely, it&rsquo;s pay-as-you-wish with a £15 suggested contribution. I try to go whenever I&rsquo;m around. You get to see a variety of material (each night has about 6 folks), and honestly I&rsquo;ve paid more for worse experiences at some ticketed shows elsewhere so I&rsquo;d happily pay the suggested £15 for Angel anytime.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is what my version of London looks like. Consider this my attempt at travel blogging. The next step is to actually catch up on my weeknote backlog and ritualise the act of actually writing things on Sunday night, instead of 2 weeks later.</p>
<p>Random thought: It would be nice to be a photographer for shy people. Like people who are quite camera-shy but would want a few nice photos of themselves that they like.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve witnessed this a lot, but I&rsquo;m still always amazed whenever I see it happen. To drive this point home - I met V at the bus stop after an NUS Hackers meetup sometime in 2018. I generally don&rsquo;t speak to strangers (in real life) because of a mix of fear and awkwardness, but recall that V is not only friendly, but is instead <em>disarmingly friendly</em>.

<ol>
<li>Richmond Park -&gt; Richmond Hill -&gt; Richmond Hill Bakery (great to sit outside and watch)</li>
</ol>
<p>Wanted to see deer and then got hungry, so I looked for the closest food place and ended up walking towards Richmond Hill Bakery. I didn&rsquo;t expect to pass by Richmond Hill, which has a great view and probably even looks even more beautiful at sunset. I saw the first wagtail of my life walking about outside Richmond Hill Bakery. Some guy asked me to help him watch his bike, so I did (but honestly I&rsquo;d be too slow to chase after anyone if someone actually tried to steal his bike).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>IKEA Madeleine -&gt; IKEA Rivoli</li>
</ol>
<p>I wanted to go find a hanging tray - or as IKEA France calls it, the <a href="https://www.ikea.com/fr/fr/p/palycke-panier-a-accrocher-80534433/">PÅLYCKE Panier à accrocher</a> (it&rsquo;s very useful!!) for G&rsquo;s kitchen as it has really little storage space, and went to the first IKEA I saw on Google. It was out of stock there, so I decided to check the next IKEA that was in stock and realised it was a 30 minutes&rsquo; walk away. This inadvertently ended up becoming a touristy walk as these two IKEAs are on the two ends of the Jardin des Tuileries. I also came across <a href="https://g.co/kgs/j6uAxfb">Koya</a> that does a great set meal with 2 onigiri + a mochi waffle + miso soup.</p>

</p>
<h1 id="why-im-a-museé-marmottan-monet-truther">Why I&rsquo;m a Museé Marmottan Monet truther</h1>
<p>Museé Marmottan Monet is dedicated to Monet, and is <em>way less crowded</em> than the Musée de l&rsquo;Orangerie. Of course you&rsquo;d have to go to the latter if you want to see the gigantic murals of water lilies, but if you&rsquo;ve been there before and want to see something else - give the Marmottan Monet a go. They have a really extensive Monet collection thanks to a donation from Michel Monet and also feature other Impressionists like Berthe Morisot:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Berthe_Morisot_-_Le_Cerisier_-_Mus%C3%A9e_Marmottan-Monet.jpg" alt="Berthe Morisot - a painting by Le Cerisier. There are two girls in a garden. One is on a ladder tending to leaves while the other is at the base of the ladder, holding a basket up to the other girl. "  />
</p>

<p>Part of the museum experience depends on the crowd. It&rsquo;s a bit hard to enjoy works when there are a lot of people around, but if you go to the Marmottan Monet on a weekday morning as I did, you are guaranteed to have seats to sit down and stare at the lilies.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1719554238/weeknote-24/photo_2024-06-28_13-55-22.jpg" alt="Monet&amp;rsquo;s water lilies paintings lined along a wall at the Museé Marmottan Monet"  />
</p>
<p>Look how empty!</p>
<h1 id="monet-and-late-blooming">Monet and late blooming</h1>
<p>In the basement where the Monet permanent collection is located, there&rsquo;s this huge wall with a timeline of Monet&rsquo;s life. I found this timeline weirdly comforting after reading the parts about his late 20s. Note that Monet was born in 1840.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1719554641/weeknote-24/photo_2024-06-28_14-03-48.jpg" alt="Timeline of Monet&amp;rsquo;s life, detailing years 1865 to 1871"  />
</p>
<p>Where this photo starts, Monet is 25. He has a pretty challenging time from 25-30 as he debuts in the Salon (&ldquo;the official, juried art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>), but ends up having to move back home to live with his family after having financial difficulties and also faces a few rejections by the Salon. Then the Franco-Prussian war breaks out.</p>
<p>The Water Lilies series which he is probably best known for was painted from the 1890s onwards. This means he started this series in his 50s (since he was born in 1840). Maybe your best work is ahead of you.</p>
<h1 id="the-strangeness-of-rest">The strangeness of rest</h1>
<p>Being able to rest and see my friends was really valuable, but also leaves me feeling very odd. I find it strange how by an accident of birth, I get to hang out with my friends and live in a place with reasonable healthcare when people are facing <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147976">genocide</a>.</p>
<p>There is a comfort in self-preservation that I can&rsquo;t relax in. Right now I&rsquo;m unemployed, and it&rsquo;s really easy to make excuses about not donating or redistributing my money but it&rsquo;s honestly quite flimsy and I try not to fall back on such things. I used to make excuses about how I can&rsquo;t talk about my personal views because I was afraid of being fired (used to work/intern in academia/government), but that&rsquo;s fallen away now too. I can give my time and money and must continue to do so, especially when states can&rsquo;t be counted on to do the right thing.</p>

I got the Raynox ME-606 in a random Hard-Off junk section (more precisely, Hard-Off at Hirata in Matsumoto) for the princely sum of 300 yen, with no real guarantees about whether it would work. This was before I wisened up and started bringing my own batteries for thrifting cameras, so all I knew was that it had corroded battery contacts and a battery flap that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t shut.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[updated 2 Jul with an additional photo]</p>
<p>I got the Raynox ME-606 in a random Hard-Off junk section (more precisely, Hard-Off at Hirata in Matsumoto) for the princely sum of 300 yen, with no real guarantees about whether it would work. This was before I wisened up and started bringing my own batteries for thrifting cameras, so all I knew was that it had corroded battery contacts and a battery flap that wouldn&rsquo;t shut.</p>

</p>
<p>A lot of my interests can be described as &ldquo;deliberate inconvenience&rdquo; (shooting with film, repairing appliances, taking random detours on walks). To keep this up, I got home and cleaned the corrosion with white vinegar&hellip;and it worked (shutter + film advance + flash worked)! I also had to tape the battery flap shut since the latch had broken off.</p>
<p>The next step was to test it with an actual roll of film. This ended up being somewhat high-stakes as most of the photos were shot on vacation, but I&rsquo;m pleased to tell you that the camera actually does work.</p>
<p>This camera has no settings to fiddle with. You don&rsquo;t even get to choose when the flash fires. It&rsquo;ll fire when it feels like it, and also takes a few seconds to charge between shots. There are no zoom or focusing options. All you really have control over is what you&rsquo;re trying to shoot.</p>
<h1 id="why-i-think-this-has-a-fixed-focal-length">Why I think this has a fixed focal length</h1>
<h2 id="doing-well-on-people--things-close-by">Doing well on people / things close by</h2>
<p>Based on how the photos turned out, I think this has a fixed focal length that&rsquo;s best for shooting people and things that are fairly close by (e.g. 0.5 metres - 2m).</p>

</p>
<p>Photo of the wall at The Projector&rsquo;s Cineleisure outlet, with messages from various creatives who&rsquo;ve performed or had their work screened there. This includes Nicole Midori Woodford (director) and Mihaya Shirata (lead actress, who plays Ami in the film) from Last Shadow After First Light, and Atsuko Okatsuka (comedian). The light leak here was pretty serendipitous as I opened the film compartment a few shots in, as I wasn&rsquo;t sure if the film was even advancing. Then I shut the compartment and continued shooting, and I guess this is where the film was partially exposed and partially intact. :) This was done at a distance of about 1m.</p>

</p>
<p>This was about 1m away at most, since it was taken across a table.</p>
<h2 id="not-so-clear-on-landscapes-but-this-is-a-matter-of-personal-taste">Not so clear on landscapes (but this is a matter of personal taste)</h2>
<p>As we get further, things get dreamier/blurrier. I guess this depends on the effect you&rsquo;re going for. As someone with astigmatism, these photos will probably help others empathise with my bad eyesight.</p>

<p>This camera really surprised me as I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it to work at all. Think it&rsquo;d do best as a camera for covering parties as it 1. has flash, 2. was really cheap (so I won&rsquo;t be precious about it), and 3. seems to do well on close-mid distance shots.</p>
<p>Another happy side effect is that I&rsquo;m less nervous about decorating it (would never do this with my Konica C35 EF or a Rollei 35T&hellip;). I have a whole bunch of stickers from when I was a kid and had a huge stationery shopping problem. It felt like I was saving them for some imaginary situation that never happened, so&hellip; I&rsquo;m learning to just use the nice thing instead of waiting for the &ldquo;right&rdquo; time to use it.</p>

I think I procrastinated a lot on weeknotes because I felt like I had nothing to say. Realised I practice a lot of unnecessary self-censorship. In the past few weeks I&rsquo;ve started helping someone out with filing a claim with the Small Claims Tribunal (I&rsquo;m basically someone&rsquo;s Computer Guy because he doesn&rsquo;t have access to a laptop and also is not fluent in English), and also finally updated my <a href="https://tomoe.asia/posts/2023-05-19-nus-grad-cert-computing-foundations/">review of classes I took for a graduate certificate</a> after much procrastinating (bit of a running theme). I even did something scary (to me). I posted about it on LinkedIn and it did reach someone who might find it useful. Yay for fighting self-censorship : )</p>
<p>This week I joined the London Bird Club for a walk, and developed a minor fixation on tomatoes.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Tomatoes in 3 ways&hellip;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Cut into wedges. Dress with olive oil, salt, pepper.</li>
<li>Tomato egg noodle, egg drop soup -style: Dice tomatoes and cook them down with olive oil till they become sauce-like. Add broth of choice. Add soy sauce, salt and pepper to your liking and simmer the soup till you&rsquo;re tired of it. Cook noodles in the broth. When it&rsquo;s about to be done, beat an egg and drizzle it into the broth to let it cook.</li>
<li>Yet another tomato egg noodle, but you fry the egg and set it aside. Reintroduce it to the pan when the noodle&rsquo;s almost done.</li>
</ol>
<p>No measurements, because I practice vibes-based cooking (just season and taste as you go).</p>
<p>I will think of more ways to eat my tomatoes. Maybe I&rsquo;ll make a tomato tomyum sauce to eat with my supermarket tortellini.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re someone who&rsquo;s wondering about whether to apply for Code in Place as a section leader, I hope this encourages you to give it a go. I had a really good experience. Applications open around April each year.</p>
<p>Code in Place is a really special thing to me, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s free! (invites a more diverse student body)</li>
<li>Everyone&rsquo;s attending because they want to (as opposed to it being a compulsory class in school)</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="being-a-beginner-is-a-gift">Being a beginner is a gift</h1>
<p>I worried about whether I was qualified enough as a programmer to even try teaching anyone since I wasn&rsquo;t a CS major, nor do I work as a developer professionally. But in this case, being a beginner is a gift if it helps you empathise with your students more easily.</p>
<p>At the time I was teaching, I was also in my first semester of taking CS classes part-time. Before that, I&rsquo;d never had any formal education in CS, and my undergrad degree wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;technical&rdquo; (non-STEM). This is something I usually feel awkward/ashamed about, but here it became something that helped me build rapport with my students.</p>
<h1 id="finding-the-right-format-for-the-class-pair-programming--weekly-roundup-posts-on-the-class-forum">Finding the right format for the class: Pair programming + weekly roundup posts on the class forum</h1>
<h2 id="pair-programming">Pair programming</h2>
<p>My first class ended up more like a lecture, and I felt terrible at the end of it because I felt I did poorly at engaging students. I wrote this on the class forum after class:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/code_in_place/pair_programming_intro" alt="Forum post to a class titled: &amp;ldquo;Next week - changing formats&amp;rdquo;. The content is as follows: Today, we did a big group gathering where I was in charge of coding, and asked all of you for help about what to do. Next week, let&amp;rsquo;s try out a different format: Everyone will be put into pairs for breakout rooms where you will collaborate with your teammate on the problem. Afterwards, we will discuss the problem together, and talk about how your breakout room&amp;rsquo;s experience was like. This will be a chance for everyone to try out pair programming. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk more about it at next week&amp;rsquo;s session. Sorry if today was not a great experience — I am trying to figure out what works best, and to become a more effective facilitator. I want to make this as good of an experience for you all as I can, because I really appreciate that you&amp;rsquo;re taking time out of your busy schedules to attend Sections. I want to make Sections a good use of your time. Thank you for your patience and see you all next week 💞"  />
</p>
<p>The following week, we tried out pair programming and the feedback from the class was much better &ndash; I realised that I should be trying to maximise the amount of time they have to collaborate with others and do coding themselves.</p>
<p>Our weekly Section ended up being structured like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction of the problem for the week</li>
<li>Breakout rooms for pair programming</li>
<li>Code Show &amp; Tell by each pair/group on:
<ol>
<li>Their approach to solving the problem</li>
<li>Challenges they faced</li>
<li>Any interesting things they came across?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="weekly-forum-posts">Weekly forum posts</h2>
<p>After each section, I&rsquo;d write down a recap of what we worked on and + responses to questions that I couldn&rsquo;t respond to on the spot in class. Having a record of what we did helped in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Students who couldn&rsquo;t make it for class that week could still get an idea of what happened, and</li>
<li>Students who attended class get to a chance to recap and review, and</li>
<li>I get more time to think and respond to questions, as opposed to having to say something on the spot. I also get to highlight some really good observations made by students in class :D</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="random-aside-to-just-talk-about-some-really-great-questions">Random aside to just talk about some really great questions</h3>
<p>Teaching is fun because of the questions you get. One really fun one was &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re writing code in Python, then what language is Python written in?&rdquo;. This was something that I didn&rsquo;t really know how to answer on the spot, so I ended up looking into it and responding in the weekly forum post. I got to learn more about language specification vs implementation. The TL;DR of this is that there are multiple implementations of Python, but the one that contains the specification of Python is <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">CPython</a>. Very fun :)</p>
<h1 id="norm-setting-in-class">Norm-setting in class</h1>
<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
<p>Some things that I&rsquo;d do from the start if I did this again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start enabling Closed Captioning by default on Zoom (I realised students were enabling this themselves when I should&rsquo;ve just enabled it by default)</li>
<li>Check if there are students who don&rsquo;t have access to a laptop. I had a student who was using a tablet which made it hard to be on a Zoom call and code at the same time, so they were usually assigned to the <a href="https://dev.to/documatic/pair-programming-best-practices-and-tools-154j#:~:text=Pair%20Programming%20is%20a%20technique,programming%20and%20offers%20various%20advantages.">&ldquo;navigator&rdquo;</a> role in pair programming.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-hard-problem-of-coming-up-with-introductionsice-breakers-that-dont-feel-weird">The hard problem of coming up with introductions/ice-breakers that don&rsquo;t feel weird</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to think of good ice-breakers. The usual one I had in university as a student at orientation activities was &ldquo;Tell us one fun fact about yourself&rdquo;, which inspired the same kind of mental glitching/short-circuiting that &ldquo;What do you want for your birthday?&rdquo; creates.</p>
<p>A good ice breaker would ideally give someone a lot of autonomy over what to answer, reveal something about their personality/values, and make as few assumptions as possible.</p>
<p>As an illustration by counter-example, here&rsquo;s what I think is a terrible ice-breaker (just for illustration, I hope nobody sincerely ever asks this):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, what does your father do for work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I eventually used for introductions was:</p>
<ol>
<li>How should we pronounce your name?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s something that you&rsquo;re proud of yourself for?</li>
</ol>
<p>This ended up being a great icebreaker but the mileage might vary for larger classes (maybe doing this over forum posts would work better instead).</p>
<h2 id="normalise-making-mistakes">Normalise making mistakes</h2>
<p>An important part of teaching is trying to remove the moral element of failure &ndash; where making mistakes seems to involve some kind of judgment that you&rsquo;re &ldquo;bad&rdquo; in some way. As Jake the Dog from Adventure Time says: &ldquo;Sucking at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I try my best to model treating mistakes with a sense of curiosity. If there&rsquo;s an error, what does it show us? Are there certain things we now know about this bit of code that we didn&rsquo;t notice before? Isn&rsquo;t that nice? I also got to model failing with that first class&rsquo; format, changing formats for the next week and getting the help of the class to give me feedback on which format they liked more (pair programming won by a very far margin).</p>
<h1 id="changing-the-way-i-talk-about-myself">Changing the way I talk about myself</h1>
<p>Code in Place made me stop talking down to myself. I have a tendency to hedge my language a lot and minimize what I do. I say I am <em>just</em> a hobbyist, or I <em>only</em> do very basic things like some web scraping or whatever because I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m skilled, I don&rsquo;t have a CS degree, I&rsquo;m not a professional software engineer blah blah blah.</p>
<p>I never had a strong wake-up call to change the way that I talk about myself until I started teaching, where I realised &ndash; as a teacher who has had more programming experience than my students, if I talk about myself like this, what am I inviting my students to think about themselves???</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like that therapy thing where you have to take what you say to yourself, and imagine that you&rsquo;re saying it to the 5 year old version of you. Would it be okay?</p>
<p>Now, even when I&rsquo;m not teaching, I try to focus on introducing myself with what I&rsquo;m learning and what I&rsquo;m curious about, rather than hedging/minimising.</p>

</p>
<h1 id="week-18">Week 18</h1>
<p>Lots of fighting with Jupyter &amp; conda, and having to work with things I barely understand like UMAP/T-SNE and k-means clustering. My lack of math understanding and training feels like a real barrier. It is quite demoralising.</p>
<p>I mostly did a lot of visualizations this week, but I don&rsquo;t know enough to properly understand why these techniques are useful and how to evaluate and optimize them. Like I get that dimensionality reduction can help us visualise how entities in a vector space are organised (since it&rsquo;s kinda hard to imagine.. 200 dimensions or something), but looking at my resulting visualizations feels like reading tea leaves most of the time.</p>
<p>On the bright side, the <code>viridis</code> colormap is not only beautiful (in my opinion) &ndash; it is <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html">designed to be robust to colorblindness, and also work when printed as grayscale</a>. Accessibility win &lt;3 so much thought goes into stuff like this.</p>
<p>Came across some code where a parameter for the number of worker threads was set to 500 when there&rsquo;s nowhere near enough resources to actually enable it to work efficiently. I LOL-ed slightly.</p>

<p>After arriving at that thought this week, I kind of had to sit and stare at the ceiling for a good while to let it sink in. Why am I used to working harder at furthering other people&rsquo;s interests than my own?</p>
<p>This week I also finally called my childhood online friend (G) who I haven&rsquo;t spoken to in a long time. One of the funny things about childhood friends is that they provide some kind of reassurance that your childhood existed - somewhere there is a 10-year-old version of me in G&rsquo;s mind, and there&rsquo;s also a 10-year-old version of G in my mind. One day you&rsquo;re 10, quarrelling with some other kid on Facebook, and the next you&rsquo;re calling each other while unpacking from a move and folding clothes (but in very different parts of the world).</p>
<hr>
<p>G: [complains about having to lug a portable aircon up the stairs]</p>
<p>Me: Your apartment doesn&rsquo;t have AC?</p>
<p>G: It was built in the 1860s.</p>
<p>Me: Well, that&rsquo;s not an excuse. They&rsquo;ve had over a hundred years to figure that out.</p>

Google says people have 20 baby teeth, and I have 18 still with me, so that&rsquo;s a pretty good yield. Molars are good for rings because they&rsquo;ve got quite a flat base and a rectangular shape. Could try other methods of setting the stone like a bezel set or prong set when I get access to the tools needed. I haven&rsquo;t really figured out what to do with incisors - maybe I&rsquo;ll get screw eye rings and turn them into charms for a necklace/bracelet.</li>
<li>first encountered and started using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/"><code>memory-profiler</code></a>. I came across some code that normalized JSON on a per-entry basis. <code>pandas.json_normalize</code> accepts JSON and returns a dataframe. This code called json_normalize for 1 entry, and then concatenates it to the existing dataframe. This ended up taking really long (&gt;8 minutes for 35000+ entries) and I wanted to compare how much time and memory it&rsquo;d take if one did the operation in batches of 5000 entries instead. <code>memory-profiler</code> was very helpful for this =)</li>
<li>helped my friend fix their Mid-2015 A1502 Macbook Pro - we replaced the speakers and the Airport card. I realised I could help because I&rsquo;ve done a speaker replacement on my own A1502. This repair was more special because my own A1502&rsquo;s just more of a backup laptop, but my friend&rsquo;s A1502 is their only laptop. Starting it up and being able to play music and access the Internet was honestly a really joyful moment.</li>

I haven&rsquo;t figured out the right term for it yet. I <a href="https://kopiti.am/@nondescryptid/112145128076061313">joked about this a bit</a> 2 weeks ago, but &ldquo;temporarily free-range&rdquo; is my top contender for now.

What matters (and what&rsquo;s kind of scary) about this time is that nobody can tell me what to do.</p>
<p>In light of this, I&rsquo;ve started off my first week by just letting myself be a degenerate. I&rsquo;ve just been sleeping a lot - more than I have in a long time. This must be how cats feel when they curl up to take a nap in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>If I had to choose a word for the week, I&rsquo;d choose &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo;. If I had to choose 8 words, it would be &ldquo;doing things I&rsquo;ve avoided for the longest time&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time this week sleeping, doing laundry, unpacking from the move, taking care of plants, and sharpening knives (sidenote: I plan on going to a knife shop next week to learn how to properly sharpen a knife and also level the whetstone I&rsquo;m using. It was my grandfather&rsquo;s, so it might very well be older than me). Haven&rsquo;t done a lot of programming-related work besides trying to learn SQL. I&rsquo;ve somehow avoided it for the longest time,like going to the dentist - but I have overcome that this week and now have very clean teeth.</p>
<p>And since no update is ever complete without some minor bug introduction - I updated my Hugo version and now my <code>date published / reading time</code> sections are borked, but I won&rsquo;t let it stop me from yapping online and publishing my posts anyway.</p>
<p>Happy update: My website actually looks fine! Hooray! But the problem happens when I use <code>hugo serve</code> locally.</p>

<p>I started my own page of <a href="https://tomoe.asia/singpass">quick links</a> to speed up my own process of connecting workers to the right e-service (for account registration, password resets) etc, but realised that I could probably make a bigger impact if I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translate my existing quick links page into Bengali and other languages</li>
<li>Convert existing Singpass documentation from <a href="">PDF</a> to machine-readable formats</li>
<li>Add a mini experiential component to get users (Work Permit) holders to experience logging in with Singpass for themselves, as reading English instructions may not be the best way to understand how to log in. This was something that kind of emerged as my informal helpdesk sessions went on &ndash; I wanted to find an <em>immediately useful</em> example to show workers how logging in works, and landed on logging in to the SG Workpass app via Singpass as my example. Logging in with Singpass allows workers to see their Work Permit validity, and also access employment information such as their salary, which can be useful in the future for any salary claims.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s got a different level of tech-savviness. It&rsquo;s quite hard to pin down, but there are some things that become second nature when you&rsquo;ve used enough devices &ndash; like knowing that clicking the bold colour button is usually the way to progress. Some guys can figure out how to navigate the registration interface fairly independently although it&rsquo;s in English, as long as I provide them with the right link for registering an account (which has to be accessed with the browser rather than the Singpass app, since such account services are not available within it). The best illustration of this is, I think, is the video &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax7f3JZJHSw">What Games Are Like For Someone Who Doesn&rsquo;t Play Games</a>&rdquo; by Razbuten.</p>
<p>If I can write good docs, make them machine-readable and responsive for mobile devices, and make them available in languages that others are familiar with, then perhaps people can get access to services like Singpass more quickly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m deeply concerned about access to services like Singpass because they are not truly optional. They&rsquo;re &ldquo;optional&rdquo; in a sense that you aren&rsquo;t legally required to use it, but accessing services without it becomes <em>much</em> harder. Alternative means for access to services when you don&rsquo;t have Singpass are not guaranteed. The Singapore Courts has the CJTS Pass which is an alternative for accessing digital services when you&rsquo;re not eligible for Singpass, but the TADM eService for filing a salary claim is gated by Singpass. I&rsquo;ll talk a bit more about the issue of alternatives means to transact in another post, when I have the time and energy to compile screenshots and archived web links.</p>

</p>
<p>I found it in the Kyoto-Katsura outlet of Hard Off (a Japanese chain that sells used electronics) for JPY2200 (about SGD20.36). Cameras in the junk section are usually untested, but this one happened to be tested! The sticker says that the shutter and flash are working, but the camera has not actually been tested with a roll of film. I tested the camera myself with the batteries I&rsquo;d brought along and confirmed that the sticker was telling the truth.</p>
<p>Besides the problem with names, film cameras also face a bit of an archival problem &ndash; manuals aren&rsquo;t always available.</p>
<p>Whenever I can&rsquo;t find manuals for my exact camera model (like the Fuji Super 115), I try to find others that kinda look like it. In this case, the manual for the Konica Z-Up 60 will do. The buttons/interface are arranged the same as the TZ-635, even though the front of the camera looks very different.</p>
<p>Someone is selling a <a href="https://www.camera-manual.com/konica-z-up-60-manual-6074">printed copy of the manual for USD13.95</a>, but you can get a free online copy if you&rsquo;re willing to look at some Japanese by going on <a href="http://gizport.jp/manual/1860464/?id=47573">gizport</a>. If you know Korean, you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1YJx2lwB4g">Meracasee&rsquo;s video</a> where they go through the features of this camera.</p>
<h1 id="things-to-note">Things to note</h1>
<p>This is a TL;DR of the Japanese Z-Up 60 manual and my own experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>This uses AA batteries</li>
<li>Lens: 35mm f/5.8 - 60mm f/9.5</li>
<li>Takes ISO 100-400 film</li>
<li>Distance:
<ul>
<li>For regular shooting: 1.60m to infinity (35mm) / 2.40m to infinity (60mm)</li>
<li>Flash: 1.00m-2.60m / 1.30m - 2.50m (based on ISO400 colour negative film)</li>
<li>Macro (Manual says &ldquo;Close-up&rdquo;): 0.50m - 0.80m / 0.55m - 0.70m</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flash is automatic and cannot be turned off unless you set it to Landscape mode</li>
<li>Self-timer mode: The timer lasts for 10 seconds. The indicator light will flash for 7 seconds, and then the flash itself will flash for 3 seconds before the shutter is activated.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>I just found it kind of funny that this was positioned right in front of a road. I nearly walked onto the road because I was trying to get a better look at it. Perhaps &ldquo;coming soon&rdquo; refers to oncoming cars.

Autofocus is a hit-or-miss thing. This one didn&rsquo;t focus quite well, but most photos are a hit for me. I&rsquo;m not very fussed about images being perfect - if I did, I wouldn&rsquo;t be using film or point-and-shoots&hellip;</p>

<h1 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h1>
<p>I really, really like this camera and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be selling it. Its build is solid enough that I can throw it into my bag without having to worry if it&rsquo;ll survive. I&rsquo;m happy with the limited sets of features. I like this more than the Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 15, where you can deactivate flash but it takes 6 presses of the MODE button.</p>

<h1 id="what-ever-happened">What ever happened?</h1>
<p>I had thrifted some cameras, and was unable to find any manuals for the Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 115 I got. It has a ton of modes like Fuzzy, Portrait, and something that looked like a self-timer and interval shooting. The problem was that I didn’t actually know how they operated.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/fuji%20zoom%20cardia%20super%20115%20with%20kodak%20colorplus/fuji-super-115" alt="Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 115, front view"  />
</p>
<p>I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytvjiX_RVSA">a video by ThisRetroLife</a> saying that the Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 115 is actually a clone of a Samsung Fuzzyzoom 1050 (also known as Zoom 1050 AF/ Maxima Zoom 105).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/fuji%20zoom%20cardia%20super%20115%20with%20kodak%20colorplus/thisretrolife-title-screenshot" alt="Screenshot of the title of ThisRetroLife&amp;rsquo;s video"  />
</p>
<p>However, the Samsung Fuzzyzoom 1050&rsquo;s maximum focal length, at 105mm (see <a href="https://quirkyguywithacamera.blogspot.com/2016/12/capable-but-complicated-samsung-maxima.html">Adam Paul’s review</a>), is 10mm short of the Fuji 115. It&rsquo;s close, but not quite.</p>
<p>I ended up looking for Samsung cameras with a focal length of up to 115mm. A rudimentary Google search gave me <a href="https://www.35mmc.com/22/10/2021/samsung-slim-zoom-1150-review/">Shawn Granton’s review of the Samsung Slim Zoom 1150</a>. Delightful! They&rsquo;re truly clones of each other.</p>
<p>Then, after trying to look up mentions of the Fuji Cardia Super 115 on Reddit, I realised that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/rtnbk0/comment/hqtob9g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">u/marakh had come to the same conclusion 2 years ago</a>, and I could’ve skipped a lot of this sleuthing if I had scoured Reddit more thoroughly to begin with:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/fuji%20zoom%20cardia%20super%20115%20with%20kodak%20colorplus/samsung-slim-zoom-comment" alt="Comment from u/marakh observing that the Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 115 is a clone of the Samsung Slim Zoom 1150"  />
</p>
<p>Typical experience of being online where I think that I&rsquo;ve done something original, then find someone else who&rsquo;s done the same thing years earlier. Tough.</p>
<p>Just for fun, I decided to try and see if I could find original prices for the Samsung and Fuji. I didn&rsquo;t manage to find one for the Fuji (please let me know if you do), but did manage to find a mention of the Samsung. The Samsung Slim Zoom 1150 used to retail for USD$599 (according to the June 1994 issue of Popular Photography<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/fuji%20zoom%20cardia%20super%20115%20with%20kodak%20colorplus/1994-pop-photography-samsung-slim-zoom-1150#center" alt="Listing from the June 1994 issue of Popular Photography stating the original retail price"  />
</p>
<p>It’s quite remarkable how these cameras have depreciated over the years. A Samsung Slim Zoom in Singapore has been sold for SGD65 (listing here). I got the Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 115 for JPY550 (SGD5-ish) in the junk section of a hardware thrift shop in Japan.</p>
<p>I guess I can’t complain about how point and shoots you can get off the shelf these days like the <a href="https://www.kodak.com/en/consumer/product/cameras/film/m35">Kodak M35</a> feel plasticky and cheap, because they really <em>are</em> cheap (relative to the original cost of the cameras I’m comparing them to).</p>
<h1 id="will-it-shoot">Will it shoot?</h1>
<p>The next thing to figure out is – will the <a href="https://cameramanuals.org/samsung/samsung_af-slim-zoom-e-s.pdf">manual</a> for the Samsung Slim Zoom 1150 also work for the Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 115?</p>
<h2 id="testing-the-multi-exposure-mode">Testing the multi-exposure mode</h2>
<p>I don’t have a Samsung Slim Zoom 1150 to conduct a point-by-point comparison, but the Samsung manual seems to hold up in relation to the multi-exposure mode. I found multi-exposure to be the mode that’s easiest to test – I don’t know how to assess if Fuzzy or Portrait work the way they’re supposed to, and I’m too stingy to test Interval and Continuous shooting.</p>
<p>The manual at page 23 states that you’re not restricted to double exposure – you can do as many exposures as you like, as long as you set the mode to multi-exposure again after each shot. This is a feature I wouldn’t have ever deduced independently.</p>
<p>I set multi-exposure 3 times for a total of 4 exposures, but I don’t think the final one showed up properly. However, you can still discern at least 3 exposures – (1) a shot of the ceiling, (2) a bulletin board with a note pinned on it, and (3) a cupboard with a jug.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder how much I should write with future people in mind &ndash; like stating more details about time and place in my photos, in case there&rsquo;s some kid from the future who needs to do a history project about wayward, bumbling 20-somethings living in Singapore in the 2020s. But I digress.</p>
<p>These were taken sometime in July 2023 with Kodak ColorPlus 200. I take photos, but don&rsquo;t really consider myself a photographer - Right now, my fascination lies with thrifting and testing these little machines as opposed to committing to the craft of composing and thinking about images. I feel bad since I feel like I&rsquo;m being a bit mercenary and not treating these cameras as nicely as I should.</p>

<h2 id="brief-overview-of-the-nus-gc-cf-1">Brief overview of the NUS GC-CF 1</h2>
<p>This is a part-time programme that&rsquo;s targeted at people who don&rsquo;t have a
formal undergraduate background in Computer Science (CS for short). It
consists of three courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IT5001 (Introductory programming course that everyone must take)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 other modules, out of these 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IT5002 Computer Systems and Applications; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IT5003 Data Structures and Algorithms; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IT5004 Enterprise Systems Architecture Fundamentals</p>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>You can read more about the NUS GC-CF 1 here:
<a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/pg/certcf/.">https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/pg/certcf/.</a></p>
<p>I started this programme in January 2023, and took 2 courses (IT5001 and
IT5003). I plan to take IT5002 in the semester starting August 2023.</p>
<h2 id="quick-note-about-taking-it5001--it5003-in-the-same-semester">Quick note about taking IT5001 + IT5003 in the same semester</h2>
<p>IT5001 is a pre-requisite for IT5003. IT5001 happens in the first 7
weeks, then IT5003 happens for the 8 weeks after that. The results for
IT5001 are confirmed about 3 weeks into IT5003.</p>
<p>This means that there is a risk of failing IT5001, then having to drop
out after 3 weeks of IT5003. The exact grades are not released to
students, but we were told that if we don&rsquo;t hear from the IT5001 team
after our IT5001 final, it means we passed the class overall and could
continue with IT5003. This was a risk I chose to take.</p>
<p>Taking both classes in the same semester also means that exams for
IT5001 will overlap with IT5003. There were some weeks where there was
class for IT5003 on Wednesday night and Saturday morning, then IT5001
exams in the afternoon / evening (Practical Exam + Final Exam).</p>
<h2 id="how-much-time-did-it-take-a-lot">How much time did it take? A lot.</h2>
<h3 id="personal-context-regarding-the-time-i-spent-for-each-class">Personal context regarding the time I spent for each class</h3>
<p>I did not enter the GC-CF I programme as a total beginner. I believe
that is the case for most of my GC-CF I classmates, as quite a few of
them were already working as software engineers / some sort of technical
role. For me, I&rsquo;ve had a bit of experience with Python such that the
content in IT5001 felt familiar, besides Object-Oriented Programming +
basic search and sorting algorithms, which were new to me. However, I don&rsquo;t think my prior experience did anything for me in IT5003 and IT5002.</p>
<h3 id="class-contact-hours-about-5-hours-a-week">Class contact hours: about 5 hours a week</h3>
<p>There are 2 sessions per week for the part-time GC-CF I students. This
usually happens on a weekday from 6.30pm-8.30pm, and on Saturday from
9am-12pm.</p>
<p>The part-time GC-CF I students and Masters of Computing (General Track)
[a.k.a MComp] share the same classes with the same module codes.
However, the amount of contact hours + syllabus may differ slightly. For
IT5001, the MComp students had extra assignments in Java that we
part-timers didn&rsquo;t have. For IT5003, there was a Recitation session on
Friday afternoons where MComp students could attend, while most of us
part-timers were at work.</p>

<h3 id="assessment">Assessment</h3>
<h4 id="weekly-assignments-20">Weekly Assignments (20%)</h4>
<p>I found these very manageable &mdash;they should be doable even if you don&rsquo;t
understand everything about the syllabus inside-out.</p>
<h4 id="midterm-20">Midterm (20%)</h4>
<p>You&rsquo;re allowed an A4 cheatsheet for this exam. It&rsquo;s a smaller version of
the final where you&rsquo;ll have an MCQ section and some short-answer
questions where you have to fill in blanks, where each blank represents
a line of code.</p>
<h4 id="practical-exam-20">Practical Exam (20%)</h4>
<p>This is an exam conducted on campus where you have to solve a few
problems within 2 hours. Code has to be submitted via the Coursemology
platform, and the catch is that you can only submit (i.e. run tests to
check if your code passes) your code 5 times. This was challenging but
fun.</p>
<h4 id="final-exam-40">Final Exam (40%)</h4>
<p>You&rsquo;re allowed an A4 cheatsheet for this exam.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t enjoy this a lot as it seems to test more esoteric knowledge,
like what the following resolves to<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<pre><code>f = lambda a, b: lambda x: b(b(a))
f('c', lambda a: a * 3)(lambda a: a[:1])
</code></pre>
<p>When in reality one would run the code and maybe step through it with a
debugger if it&rsquo;s not clear (that&rsquo;s what I did anyway, since I&rsquo;m not good
at lambda functions&hellip;) and realise it gives you &lsquo;ccccccccc&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Another funny example<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>:</p>
<pre><code>print(5-+-+-+-5) 
</code></pre>
<p>This feels illegal but is actually valid, and evaluates to 10.</p>
<h3 id="time-spent-outside-of-class-3-hours-a-week">Time spent outside of class (~3 hours a week)</h3>
<p>I spent about 3 hours outside of class a week (on average) working on
the assignments and studying, mostly because Prof Alan&rsquo;s lecture style
doesn&rsquo;t require us to do pre-reading + the content was largely familiar
except for the stuff at the end about Object-Oriented Programming and
Binary Search + Merge Sort.</p>
<h3 id="syllabus-i-got-this-from-my-lecture-slide-titles">Syllabus (I got this from my lecture slide titles)</h3>
<p>Week 1: Usual intro, course information and what functions are</p>
<p>Week 2: Selection and Loops, Variable Scope, Recursion</p>

<h3 id="unsolicited-advice">Unsolicited advice:</h3>
<p>I spent more time on the module towards the end as I had not worked on
my cheatsheet throughout the semester. This was a mistake on my part
&mdash;just keep a Word document around, and write down any weird quirky
behaviour about Python that you come across. It&rsquo;ll come in useful for
your cheatsheet.</p>

<p><strong>Important note:</strong> <strong>This class was taught by Dr Steven Halim, who uses
the Flipped Classroom</strong> <strong>approach.</strong> This meant that there was a fair
amount of reading to do each week. The readings came in the form of the
E-Lecture mode on <a href="https://visualgo.net/en" title="null">Visualgo</a>.</p>
<p>Please do your readings. I don&rsquo;t think I would&rsquo;ve had a chance of
surviving if I went into lectures with 0 context, because he runs
lectures assuming that you&rsquo;ve gone through the content and have some
basic idea about what&rsquo;s going on, and spends more time focusing on
complicated/less intuitive parts.</p>
<h3 id="time-spent-outside-of-class-8-15-hours-a-week">Time spent outside of class (~8-15 hours a week)</h3>
<p>IT5003 took about 3x or 4x the time that IT5001 took me. I attribute
this to the content being novel to me, and also the flipped classroom
approach meant that there was pre-class prep we needed to do.</p>
<p>Each week kinda ended up looking like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wednesday lecture + weekly problem set (pset) release</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thursday - Weekends: Pre-reading for class, doing the pset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monday to Wednesday: If I didn&rsquo;t manage to do the pset by the
weekend, this was a bad crunch time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assessment-1">Assessment</h3>
<h4 id="weekly-problem-sets-24">Weekly Problem Sets (24%)</h4>
<p>Each problem set consists of 2 problems (A and B). Problem A is easier
than Problem B. I would say the time I spent on problem sets was split
25%-75% between Problems A and B.</p>
<p>These were done on a platform called Kattis, which I would describe as
&ldquo;Leetcode that&rsquo;s mostly used by universities&rdquo;[^3]. The main challenge
for this is passing all the test cases, and doing so within the time and
memory limits of the automated judge.</p>
<h4 id="visualgo-quiz-1-11">VisuAlgo Quiz 1 (11%)</h4>
<p>Covered sorting, lists, heaps. This is a quiz on the VisuAlgo platform
that&rsquo;s multiple choice / short answer with some other topic-specific
tasks, like drawing a graph and whatnot. This quiz is 15 minutes long.</p>
<h4 id="visualgo-quiz-2-12">VisuAlgo Quiz 2 (12%)</h4>
<p>Covers all topics of IT5003. This comes in the final week of class. This
quiz is 15 minutes long.</p>
<h4 id="final-exam-50">Final Exam (50%)</h4>
<p>I came out of this feeling very defeated. I don&rsquo;t think I passed (at the
time of writing). There&rsquo;s a mix of MCQs, short-answer questions and a
final problem-solving part. You can check out a past paper

<p>Official class site is here, with a detailed week-by-week syllabus:
<a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/it5003.html.">https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/it5003.html.</a> There is no point
in me repeating it here &mdash;you are better off looking at Dr Steven
Halim&rsquo;s site instead. He also has a draft schedule for the semester
starting in August 2023:
<a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/it5003.html#lessonplannew">https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/it5003.html#lessonplannew</a></p>
<h3 id="unsolicited-advicereflections">Unsolicited Advice/Reflections</h3>
<p>Block the ranking system on Kattis. Kattis displays rankings for the
entire class and shows the first 30-ish who solve the problem set. I
used Brave browser&rsquo;s &ldquo;Block Element&rdquo; feature to prevent me from seeing
the little banner at the top of every page which shows your ranking for
the current problem sets. There was also a Rankings page, which I
generally avoided looking at until <em>after</em> solving the pset. I did this
because I realised it made me anxious to see that oh, people have solved
this within 2 hours of the pset being released while I&rsquo;m still
struggling and failing Test Case 2/45. Perhaps you are more stoic, but
this is what worked for me as an anxious person.</p>
<p>Train for the VisuAlgo quizzes by doing the Training modules on
VisuAlgo. The quizzes have the highest time-to-points ratio. No other
part of the assessments will let you get 20-ish% of your grade in 30
minutes (total time for Quiz 1 + Quiz 2). I got blindsided by the weekly
assignments because I have this bad habit where I get incredibly hung up
on an unsolved problem, when I should&rsquo;ve optimised for spending more
time on grinding out practice for the VisuAlgo quizzes instead. Don&rsquo;t
make my mistake!</p>
<p>Accept that the 8 weeks are going to be difficult. This was one of the
most challenging classes I&rsquo;ve taken. Besides the content being new,
there&rsquo;s a psychological dimension where I had to manage my own feelings
about work not only being difficult, but also being in a class where
there are people who are miles ahead. The GC-CF I is not a genuine
introductory programme where everyone has the same degree of
inexperience. It feels more like being in a university language class
where people are like, <em>yeah I never studied this but I&rsquo;ve been
translating anime subtitles for a few years as a self-taught Japanese
speaker</em>. I had classmates who would solve the psets within the same day they came out (if not, within hours), and they did
this <em>every week.</em></p>
<p>The trick, I think, is to view this situation with a sense of awe and
curiosity rather than turning all these feelings into a way to put
yourself down like <em>oh I am terrible and so slow at this, I can&rsquo;t ever
get a job as a SWE</em>. Instead I like to think about stuff like: How did
they make their code more efficient? How did they think through the
problem? How can I do this too?</p>
<p>The good part of this being a classroom environment is that you know
there <em>is</em> a solution (and other people have found it). This is
different from research where one can possibly throw thousands of
dollars in grant money and years down the drain to find a solution which
may or may not actually exist. It also helps that a lot of people on the
class Discord are very helpful and generous with their time. I think all
this suffering throughout the course created a sense of camaraderie
where we all want to see each other pass test cases on Kattis.</p>
<p>At the time of writing (20 May 2023), I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve passed IT5003
as we haven&rsquo;t gotten our results. I suspect that even if I have, I&rsquo;ve
gotten a C or D or something like that because my VisuAlgo quizzes were
pretty mid, and the Final was horrendous for me. But I&rsquo;ve definitely
learned a lot, and I&rsquo;m glad that I achieved what I set out to do.
Earlier in the semester, Dr Steven gave us a list of things to introduce
ourselves with:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.pubpub.org/59z5xjtt/51684517956677.png" alt=""  />

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.pubpub.org/zs58dfkj/61684518019463.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve done what my past self was hoping to do. I deal with
struggling much better now, and also made some memes I was happy with
along the way:</p>

</p>
<p>Hope this helps, and all the best with the GC-CF 1 if you end up doing
it!</p>
<p>[Update 27 May 2024: I forgot to update about this, but I somehow passed the class]</p>
<h2 id="it5002-computer-systems-and-applications-aug-dec-2023">IT5002: Computer Systems and Applications (Aug-Dec 2023)</h2>
<p>I had talked a bit about this class on the <a href="https://t.me/projectintern/20681">Project Intern</a> chat, but here&rsquo;s the full review!</p>
<p>This class aims to cover 2 parts: (1) Computer Organisation and (2) Operating Systems. In the NUS CS undergrad curriculum, each part is covered by its own module, namely CS2100 (Computer Organisation) and CS2106 (Intro to Operating Systems). The undergrad equivalents cover these topics in a lot more depth. You can refer to materials for these classes too :D</p>
<p>The most useful thing I can contribute would probably be recommendations for external resources, because I spent a lot of time scurrying about online finding alternative things to read.</p>
<h3 id="course-outline">Course outline:</h3>
<p>According to my notes on Obsidian:</p>
<p>Week 1 - Intro</p>
<p>Week 2 - Number systems</p>
<p>Week 3 - MIPS Instructions I</p>
<p>Week 4 - MIPS Instructions II</p>
<p>Week 5 - Datapath</p>
<p>Week 6 - Control Unit</p>
<p>Week 7 - Pipelining and Caching</p>
<p>Week 8 - ??? (My notes somehow don&rsquo;t have this LOL)</p>
<p>Week 9 - Process Management and Scheduling</p>
<p>Week 10 - Scheduling and Inter-process Communication</p>
<p>Week 11 - Memory Management &amp; File Systems</p>
<h3 id="class-hours-4-hours-a-week">Class hours (4 hours a week)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tuesdays 6.30pm-9.30pm: Lecture</li>
<li>Saturday: 1 hour tutorial (timing depends on which group you get assigned to)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-spent-outside-of-class-on-average-4-6-hours-a-week">Time spent outside of class (on average 4-6 hours a week)</h3>
<p>I had to spend quite a lot of time outside of class catching up because I found it hard to absorb content in 3 hour lectures after work. I spent less time overall on this class compared to IT5003, but it subjectively felt worse because I was just tired and confused after lectures because my attention span is quite short. I spent the bulk of my time outside of class consulting external resources and sometimes rewatching lectures.</p>
<h3 id="assessments">Assessments</h3>
<h4 id="tutorialslabs-5">Tutorials/Labs (5%)</h4>
<p>We get a weekly tutorial sheet to work on, but I was mostly really confused and not fully caught-up by the time the tutorial rolled around (on the bright side, tutorials were online). I&rsquo;ve got to confess that I was profoundly silent on Zoom. Most of my participation in this module happened on the class Canvas forum where I tried to answer classmates&rsquo; questions closer to finals, which was when things started clicking a bit more for me.</p>
<h4 id="mid-term-25">Mid-term (25%)</h4>
<p>This is heavy on number systems, tracing MIPS instructions and caching stuff. I did horrendous for this, and was relieved to find out that I had only failed the midterm by half a mark. There was something along the lines of &ldquo;how many bytes will you need in total for a 48KB direct-mapped write-through cache (including tag and other bits)&rdquo; and I was just like&hellip; huh ??</p>
<h4 id="take-home-assignment-15">Take-home assignment (15%)</h4>
<p>The assignment concerns multithreading &amp; multiprocessing in
Python (this language choice probably occurs because most of the grad cert is taught in Python). Very doable (even by my standards).</p>
<h4 id="final-exam-55">Final exam (55%)</h4>
<p>I found this difficult to complete within the time limit (2 hours?). I didn&rsquo;t finish the paper. I frankly don&rsquo;t remember most of it because I felt really disoriented. There was a question that involved writing down the block numbers that a certain file&rsquo;s inode pointers would point to given that a particular thing has X sectors with Y blocks that are Z MB each or something.</p>
<h3 id="unsolicited-advice--resources-i-recommend">Unsolicited Advice / Resources I recommend</h3>
<p>Out of the 3 classes, I referred to external resources the most for this one. I didn&rsquo;t really use the recommended textbook(Computer Organization and Design by Patterson and Hennessy).</p>

I also remarked that it was kind of impressive as I don&rsquo;t think I could&rsquo;ve monetized my personal data like this (to the point of having kombucha on tap, and more lunch options than one could meaningfully try in one meal).</p>
<p>While somewhat funny, it also reflects the way I&rsquo;ve been slowly socialised to think about software as in terms of these things:</p>
<p>Monetization, MRR, ARR. Users. Maximizing. All-consuming, constantly devouring and growing. Extractive. The half-arsed GDPR compliance consent modals where the option that has the least cookies takes the most clicks to get to. Series whatever funding.</p>
<p>When did things become like this, and when did I start thinking this way about software?</p>
<p>Part of repairing my relationship with technology and recovering my sense of agency has involved thinking about the joy I felt as a kid online. In my teenage years, I stubbornly believed that I wasn&rsquo;t quite cut out for computer stuff because I was bad at math (whatever that meant to my younger self). I don&rsquo;t know how I typecast myself that way. It&rsquo;s all quite sad, because my kid self loved learning about customising my Neopets page and fiddling with Tumblr themes. I co-hosted a Facebook group for pen spinning with other kids my age, that ended up growing to include people who actually competed in the United Pen Spinning Board Tournament (sadly the message board no longer exists). At some point, my mother realised I was using Facebook as a kid and decided to block it on our home network. In response to that, I learnt how to use Tor after much googling, and willingly waited 5 minutes for pages to load, just because I <em>really</em> wanted to play Mousehunt (and also because it guaranteed me a failsafe common conversational topic with my classmates). There was a sense of unbridled agency, as a kid growing up online, that I kind of lost along the way.</p>
<p>Another part of this repair has involved discovering other people online who embody a sense of play and wonder when it comes to technology. Lately, I came across <a href="https://we-b.site/">(we)bsite</a>, which invites people to think about their dreams for the internet. There are opportunities for small, anonymous interactions (seeing others&rsquo; cursors), and enjoying non-intrusive collective online presence. (I&rsquo;ve also just learnt that you can have live cursor chat by pressing &ldquo;/&rdquo;, so I&rsquo;ll try that later at night since most people who&rsquo;ve been on the site seem to be in US time.)</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I&rsquo;ve stumbled upon and have found restorative and joyful:</p>
<p>// <a href="http://feral.earth/">feral web</a></p>
<p>// <a href="https://natto.dev/">natto.dev</a></p>
<p>// <a href="https://twitter.com/soft_networks">soft networks</a></p>

<p>// <a href="https://www.spencerchang.me/window/">wall of windows</a></p>
<p>// <a href="https://sfpc.study/">society for poetic computation</a></p>
<p>// <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">recurse center</a></p>
<p>Dreaming is a powerful thing. I dream of software that doesn&rsquo;t want to eat the world. I dream of software that can just be enough for me and my community. Software that delights and tends to the better angels of ourselves. I want to make more things to play with even if nobody else uses them, like a little <a href="https://inmyroom.vercel.app/">space</a> where you can drag and drop a few things, and a frontend for <a href="https://emnlp2022.tomoe.asia/">viewing papers for a conference</a>. Dream a little electric dream for me.</p>

<p><strong>LawNet Free Resources</strong></p>
<p>There is keyword search functionality that returns a list of results, but without excerpts of where the keywords are found:
<img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/lawnet-posts/lawnet-free-rss-search" alt="Screenshot of Lawnet&amp;rsquo;s Free Resources page search results for the keyword &amp;ldquo;drug trafficking&amp;rdquo;"  />
</p>
<p><strong>CommonLII</strong></p>
<p>Search functionality is more extensive as they support the following options:</p>

</p>
<p>Its drawback is the same as LawNet&rsquo;s free resource page &ndash; there are no excerpts of the search results. There are percentage similarity rates on the side (e.g. [100%]), but as a user I don&rsquo;t know what it really means.</p>
<p>Having an excerpt would help users get an idea of the result&rsquo;s relevance without having to click and open the judgment.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>OGP&rsquo;s OpenDoc</strong></p>
<p>The OpenDoc team from Open Government Products has a repo with cases from 2019 onwards. However, they&rsquo;re all in markdown files and the link it used to be hosted at &ndash; <a href="https://state-court-judgments.opendoc.sg/">https://state-court-judgments.opendoc.sg/</a> &ndash; is no longer working.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-use-case-for-organizing-judgments-by-recency">What&rsquo;s the use case for organizing judgments by recency?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice that there&rsquo;s at least a source for State Court judgments, but I&rsquo;m not sure of why the resource was designed in this way to limit users to the past 3 months of judgments.</p>
<p>My assumption is that people such as litigants-in-person tend to look for cases based on subject matter such as the area of law, specific fact patterns, statutory provisions etc. If this is true, then their ability to find the information they&rsquo;re looking for is stunted by the fact that they are only able to search for cases whose judgments have been reported within the past 3 months at the time of querying.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-search-for-state-court-cases-are-not-great-either-paying-for-lawnet-nlb-eresources">Alternatives to search for State Court cases are not great either: Paying for Lawnet, NLB eResources</h2>
<h3 id="paying-for-lawnet">Paying for Lawnet</h3>
<p><strong>Half an hour of Lawnet under the pay-per-use scheme = 9 Filet-o-Fish meals</strong>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Pay-per-use is SGD57.53 for the first 30 minutes and SGD8 for every subsequent half an hour.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/lawnet-posts/lawnet-pay-per-use" alt="Screenshot of Lawnet&amp;rsquo;s pay-per-use rates. It costs SGD57.53 for the first 30 minutes."  />
</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using the pay-per-use rate as it&rsquo;s the cheapest. Otherwise, the standard monthly subscription is SGD206.92 (~33 FoF meals).</p>
<p>This honestly doesn&rsquo;t sound great. Free and open access to law matters because litigants-in-person are already at a disadvantage if their counterparty has counsel &ndash; we don&rsquo;t need to exacerbate this inequality by making them worse-off in terms of access to legal information too. Even out of the litigant-in-person paradigm, I think judgments should be open for public viewing and study as courts are institutions financed by taxpayer money anyway.</p>
<h3 id="nlb-eresources">NLB eResources</h3>
<p>NLB eResources gave me some false hope as their eResources are generally great &ndash; getting Udemy courses for free through nlbsg.udemy.com and having access to JSTOR is fantastic. However, eResource access to Lawnet is another thing altogether.</p>
<p>After logging in with myLibrary ID, navigating to eResources and finding &ldquo;Lawnet&rdquo;, I realised that Lawnet can only be accessed at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library. As NLB points out, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;limited to 1 user access only&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/lawnet-posts/nlb-lawnet-resource" alt="Screenshot of the national library&amp;rsquo;s eResource for Lawnet"  />
</p>
<p>This involves quite a few steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making myLibrary ID</li>
<li>Logging in with myLibrary account</li>
<li>Going to eResources and finding &ldquo;Lawnet&rdquo;</li>
<li>Realising that there is no online access from my computer, and that I have to go down in person.</li>
<li>Finding library opening times</li>
<li>Finding a day and time to go down to the library</li>
<li>Finally accessing LawNet (and also praying there isn&rsquo;t already another user there)</li>
</ol>
<p>This access is &ldquo;free&rdquo; in the sense that I don&rsquo;t have to pay for it, but comes with a lot of other costs. I had to go through steps (1)-(4) only to find out that there&rsquo;s actually no online access via NLB eResources.</p>
<p>Free access should also entail removing non-price barriers to access as much as possible. Sometimes, it looks like removing <a href="https://sushant354.blogspot.com/2009/04/letter-to-allahabad-high-court-removing.html?m=1">image captchas</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it looks like not making people physically travel down to access a resource where only one person can access it at a time.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions?</h3>
<p>Idk, it&rsquo;d be nice to make LawNet available on a freemium model where basic search functions are free. IndianKanoon does that. The fancier research management stuff + precedent access can be left to law firms to pay for. Or the Courts could even just provide access (with no search functionality) to judgments in machine-readable format so that devs can build tools for it.</p>
<p>As of 3 Jan 2023, SAL has reorganised its digital services under a new subsidiary called <a href="https://www.sal.org.sg/newsroom/LawNet-Technology-Services#:~:text=SAL%20to%20reorganise%20its%20digital,subsidiary%20%7C%20Singapore%20Academy%20of%20Law&amp;text=SINGAPORE%2C%203%20January%202023%20%E2%80%94%20The,Services%20(%E2%80%9CLTS%E2%80%9D)">LawNet Technology Services</a>. Looking forward to see what they do.</p>
<p>Until then, I guess&hellip;just use CommonLII. And tell your friends about it! I had no clue until huey told me.</p>

<p>TL;DR I set up a Docassemble instance using the <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/practical-guide-docassemble/setup-server">Suffolk LIT Lab Legal Tech Class textbook</a> (written by Quinten Steenhuis &amp; other contributors), with AWS Lightsail and S3. You can check it out at <a href="https://docassemble.tomoe.asia">docassemble.tomoe.asia</a>. Do back up your docassemble interviews though, because I might not pay for this Lightsail instance forever. :P</p>
<p>Instead of setting up a nice sensible local install, I decided that I might as well try to learn how to use AWS before my free AWS credits from one of the JuniorDev meetups expired.</p>
<p>As usual, setting things up is never straightforward, but here are the things I&rsquo;ve learnt to pay more attention to (in decreasing order of significance):</p>
<h1 id="1-learning-how-to-isolate-a-problem">1. Learning how to isolate a problem.</h1>
<p>I could not, for the life of me, access my server at the start. Nothing was loading when I accessed the address I&rsquo;d mapped to it. Logging is an important part of the troubleshooting process as finding out what exactly is going on helps to locate the problem.</p>
<h1 id="2-logs-as-the-first-port-of-call">2. Logs as the first port of call</h1>
<p>To get some sense of what&rsquo;s going on, referring to Docassemble&rsquo;s documentation helped a lot as it provided advice on <a href="https://docassemble.org/docs/docker.html#troubleshooting">troubleshooting through viewing logs</a></p>
<p>After logging the <code>initialize</code> process, I realised that it could not connect to my AWS S3 endpoint URL.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/debugging-doc-initialize.png" alt="Logs for initialization process"  />
</p>
<p>This is where I realised that I had a typo in my env.list file, where I&rsquo;d typed my server region (ap-southeast-1a) instead of my S3 region (ap-southeast-1). Typos have material consequences here, sometimes more so than law.</p>
<h1 id="3-solving-one-problem-sometimes-means-paving-the-way-to-find-another-one">3. Solving one problem sometimes means paving the way to find another one.</h1>
<p>After I fixed my env.list config blunder, I checked the logs and everything seemed to be fine (appropriate processes were running/terminated). However, accessing docassemble.tomoe.asia still wasn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>Why ?????</p>
<p>To locate the (new) problem, I had to recognise that there are at least 2 points of failure:</p>
<ol>
<li>The docassemble instance itself</li>
<li>Connecting the docassemble instance to a domain name</li>
</ol>
<p>I realised it was (2) after I successfully accessed the site with my static IP address. I can&rsquo;t remember what exactly I did to fix it though, but I remember it&rsquo;s where the problem was.</p>
<h1 id="4-silly-mistakes-will-happen-so-just-have-a-good-sense-of-humour-about-it-but-also-remember-to-fix-them">4. Silly mistakes will happen, so just have a good sense of humour about it (but also remember to fix them)</h1>
<p>After the env.list blunder, something new happened while I was trying to add a HTTPS connection (so I don&rsquo;t look like a scammer when friends try my server and are told that their connection is not secure). I was setting stuff up with Let&rsquo;s Encrypt, but HTTPS wasn&rsquo;t happening.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no particular method to this, but after staring at the Suffolk LIT guide, I realised that I had accidentally skipped a step in enabling HTTPS connections for my IPv4 Firewall. 🤡</p>
<p>Sometimes, trying to do things while my eyes are dry and tired means that I skip crucial steps. I will try not to deploy things at 2 in the morning and instead learn to stop, and carry on the next day. <strong>I have to accept that I cannot solve every problem I face in one sitting.</strong> This will become more true as the size and complexity of problems I face increases. If I can solve every problem in one sitting, it means that I&rsquo;m probably not pushing my limits in terms of seeking out harder problems to solve.</p>

<p><strong>(2) Making the header sticky</strong></p>
<p>This was less straightforward than I thought it would be. Making the header itself sticky was relatively simple as the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_sticky_element.asp"><code>position</code> property has a <code>sticky</code> attribute</a>. However, a new problem arose where I realised that the Filter section is inside a container (CardContainer.js). I put the cards and filter in the same file as it&rsquo;s easy to setState for search and filtering. However, I now need to make the Filter section its own component, so that I can add it to the header instead, such that the filter section persists while people are scrolling.</p>
<p>Currently, the filter section behaves like this, which is ugly and also not user-friendly:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/sticky-scroll.gif" alt="GIF showing problems with a sticky div within another div"  />
</p>
<p>I find my understanding of React very rudimentary &ndash; I know enough about it to get things to work, but I&rsquo;m not at the level where I understand all the different approaches to managing State and what exactly the best practices are. However, I can always build on this project by refactoring it when I learn of a better way to do things, so that&rsquo;s cool. Incremental learning!</p>
<p>More to-dos / feature wishlist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate routes for individual papers, so that they can be shared with others. Otherwise it&rsquo;ll just be emnlp2022.tomoe.asia &ndash; there&rsquo;s no way to uniquely identify these resources</li>
<li>Allow users to remove saved papers</li>
</ul>
<p>I also fiddled about with my syntax highlighter for the site today, so apologies if it looks janky :P</p>

I would try to declare a variable where <code>variable = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(&quot;saved&quot;))</code> (where &ldquo;saved&rdquo; is an array) or something like that, then use it in my component where I&rsquo;d map it, but I would get an error stating that there is no such variable.</p>
<p><strong>Server-side rendering v client-side rendering</strong>
This issue exists due to a difference between server and client-side rendering (Next.js uses server-side rendering). localStorage is available as part of the browser API which only exists on the client&rsquo;s browser. This is something I don&rsquo;t entirely understand <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but I resolved this issue by getting items from localStorage within the useEffect() hook thanks to this article: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-localstorage-with-react-hooks-to-set-and-get-items/">How to Use localStorage with React Hooks to Set and Get Items</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Updating saved papers from the individual card components</strong></p>
<p>My web app has 2 main components when it comes to showing cards (containing details about papers):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>CardContainer.js (Parent)
|
|- Card.js (Child)
</code></pre><p>CardContainer contains the array of papers from EMNLP&rsquo;s Excel sheet, and maps each of these papers to a corresponding Card component. It also contains the array of papers that have been saved in localStorage.</p>
<p>However, the act of &ldquo;saving&rdquo; occurs when one clicks on the &ldquo;Save&rdquo; button in a Card component. Then, how do I update CardContainer&rsquo;s (parent) state from the Card (child) component?</p>
<p>After checking out bobbyhadz&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/react-pass-function-as-prop#:~:text=Define%20the%20function%20in%20the,function%20in%20the%20child%20component.">How to pass a Function as props in React</a>&rdquo;, I passed my CardContainer&rsquo;s setSaved() function as a prop into the Card component:</p>
<p>CardContainer:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>    const [savedPapers, setSaved] = useState([])
    ...
    papers.map(paper =&gt; (&lt;Card paper={paper} setSaved={setSaved}/&gt;
</code></pre><p>Card:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>const Card = ({paper, setSaved}) =&gt; {
    ...
    function savePaper(){
        setSaved(items =&gt; [...items, paper])
    }
    return (
        &lt;&gt; {paper &amp;&amp;  &lt;div className={styles.card}&gt;
        &lt;button onClick={savePaper}&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt;
}
</code></pre><p>I used a spread operator to create a copy of the existing array into a new array where I can add other elements. This works, but I wonder if I should just try passing the entire &ldquo;Saved&rdquo; array as a prop and then .push() to it. I used this current solution as I didn&rsquo;t feel like adding another prop, but that&rsquo;s not really a technically informed choice&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Progress/Reflections:</strong></p>
<p>Papers can now be saved, but the UI isn&rsquo;t very user-friendly at the moment as there&rsquo;s no feedback on when you&rsquo;re viewing the Saved papers or just browsing the original array of papers. It&rsquo;s possible to deactivate the &ldquo;saved&rdquo; view by clicking &ldquo;View Saved&rdquo; again, but it&rsquo;s not intuitive &ndash; I know how to use this because I wrote it, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be friendly for people who are using it for the first time.</p>
<ul>
<li>I might want to change the &ldquo;View Saved&rdquo; button&rsquo;s text to &ldquo;Return to Browsing&rdquo; when Saved Papers are being shown.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also no validation for duplicate saved papers, so it is possible to show multiples of the same paper in the Saved Papers view by clicking one paper&rsquo;s Save button several times. I should implement validation next.</p>
<p>Also, I think I should use modals for showing abstracts instead of replacing the cards&rsquo; contents on click &ndash; it&rsquo;s not a nice viewing experience on desktop (with 2 columns) and isn&rsquo;t a good utilisation of space as the paper&rsquo;s abstract is contained within the column that the card is in. This means that only half the viewport&rsquo;s being used. :\</p>

My div with the filter+search elements was also way outside the viewport, which made me realise that divs don&rsquo;t inherit the dimensions of parents. So I ended up using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/fit-content"><code>fit-content</code></a> to get my <code>div</code> to fit the container. Frontend is fun, but it also makes my head hurt because there are so many kinds of behaviours to learn (don&rsquo;t even mention flexbox / grid).</p>
<p>But anyway, I&rsquo;m glad that it kinda works now. There are a few more things I would like to learn to implement:</p>
<ul>
<li>saving papers, and viewing them with localStorage</li>
<li>chaining multiple filters (e.g. filtering by submission type + track)</li>
<li>allow multi-select for conference tracks, so that I can view several tracks&rsquo; papers at once, as opposed to one track at a time (which is the case with my current dropdown)</li>
<li>automating the generation of unique values for each type of filter (to get the array of conference tracks, I went to some random website that helps you remove duplicates from lists&hellip; not my best moment to be honest). The idea here, I guess, is to create something I can easily use for another kind of entity that I want to view and filter.</li>
<li>make header sticky so my header doesn&rsquo;t jump about depending on the number of search results</li>
</ul>

Which means I&rsquo;m almost halfway through the 100 days (in total, not in a row).</p>
<p>I restarted CS50 for 2 main reasons:</p>
<p>(1) closure</p>
<p>Partially to get closure on the fact that it was the first thing I ever touched relating to code, but I never finished it because I was very new and not at a state where I have the kind of will and faith to finish it. But it&rsquo;s been a good month so far &ndash; I&rsquo;ve learnt a lot, and also feel like I can see how I&rsquo;m very different from the kid 4 years ago touching Scratch and C for the first time.</p>
<p>(2) improving my foundations</p>
<p>My data structures &amp; algo knowledge is really weak and I wanted to get a better handle on things like pointers, hash tables. After going through the first 5 weeks of content in C, I can appreciate why they force us to use C &ndash; you&rsquo;ll understand memory allocation and the relevance of linked lists a lot better when you understand the kinds of problems faced by storing stuff in contiguous slots of memory.</p>
<p>Anyway, strongly recommend doing the course. And also would like to remind anyone who&rsquo;s been discouraged by the course that it&rsquo;s okay to take a step back and learn other things, then return to it.</p>
<p>Things work out in the fullness of time.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>day 23</title><link>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-10-05-day-23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-10-05-day-23/</guid><description>Learnt more about Chrome extensions by updating the manifest of a Chrome extension that wasn&amp;rsquo;t working for me.

<p>These are the pieces of writing I&rsquo;ve found myself returning to, and referring others to over time, accompanied by my own random comments. They mostly relate to thinking about labour, time and everyday decision-making.</p>
<h3 id="work-is-infinite-but-its-not-a-bad-thing"><strong>Work is infinite but it&rsquo;s not a bad thing</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people seem to think the &lsquo;good&rsquo; state of being, the &lsquo;ground&rsquo;
state, is a relaxed state, a state with lots of rest and very little
action. Because they think the ground state is the relaxed state, they
act like maintaining any other state requires effort, requires
suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a failure mode that I used to fall into pretty regularly. I
would model my work as a finite stream of tasks that needed doing. I&rsquo;d
think &ldquo;once I&rsquo;ve done the laundry and bought new shoes and finished the
grocery shopping and fixed the bugs in my code and finished the big
refactor, everything will be in order, and I&rsquo;ll be able to rest.&rdquo; And in
that state of mind, every new email that hit my inbox, every new bug
discovered in my code, every tool of mine that wore down and needed
repair, would deal me damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I was modeling my work as finite, with the rest state being the state
where all tasks were completed, and so every new task would push me
further from that precious rest state and wear me down.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But the work that needs to be done is not a finite list of tasks, it
is a neverending stream. Clothes are always getting worn down, food is
always getting eaten, code is always in motion. <strong>The goal is not to
finish all the work before you; for that is impossible. The goal is
simply to move through the work. Instead of struggling to reach the end of the stream, simply focus on moving along it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ndash; Nate Soares, <a href="https://mindingourway.com/rest-in-motion/">Rest in Motion</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The magical property of work is that there is always more of it. It&rsquo;s there when you sleep, and it&rsquo;s there when you wake up. Go to sleep and stop punishing yourself. Resting is part of the work.</p>
<h3 id="problems-dont-have-to-be-technically-challenging-for-them-to-be-worthwhile"><strong>Problems don&rsquo;t have to be technically challenging for them to be worthwhile</strong></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Difficult&rdquo; tends to equate to &ldquo;prestigious&rdquo; in school because it&rsquo;s used as a proxy for your ability to suffer and also deal with technically hard things. But as Ben Kuhn points out in <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/hard/">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to work on hard problems&rdquo;</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>School is a closed-world domain—you are solving crisply-defined puzzles (multiply these two numbers, implement this algorithm, write a book report by this rubric), your solution is evaluated on one dimension (letter grade), and the performance ceiling (an A+) is low. The only form of progression is to take harder courses. If you try to maximize your rewards under this reward function, you’ll end up looking for trickier and trickier puzzles that you can get an A+ on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The real world is the polar opposite. You’ll have some ultra-vague end goal, like “help people in sub-Saharan Africa solve their money problems,” based on which you’ll need to prioritize many different sub-problems. A solution’s performance has many different dimensions (speed, reliability, usability, repeatability, cost, …)—you probably don’t even know what all the dimensions are, let alone which are the most important. The range of plausible outcomes covers orders of magnitude and the ceiling is saving billions of lives. The habits you learn by working on problem sets won’t help you here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leaving school presents you with a lot of agency, which is terrifying in its own right. I graduated a few months back and find that I&rsquo;m mainly chewing over (1) What should I be optimizing for? and (2) How do I cultivate my ability to deal with the higher-order question of what problems I should be working on, as opposed to finding ways to work on problems that have already been presented to me? I don&rsquo;t really have great answers for them yet.</p>
<h3 id="being-clear-on-trade-offs"><strong>Being clear on trade-offs</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Being clear on your motivations</strong></p>
<p>R.W. Hamming&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/dahlin/bookshelf/hamming.html">&ldquo;You and your research&rdquo;</a> has a nice heuristic for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the important problems in your field?</li>
<li>What important problems are you working on / might lead to important results?</li>
<li>If what you are working on is not important and is not likely to lead to important things, why are you working on them?</li>
</ol>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that everything has to be instrumental, just that it&rsquo;s a good exercise to clarify what your motivations for doing different things are. Sometimes the answer is &ldquo;I just find it fun&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose vs curiosity</strong></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this piece by Scott Young (<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2009/02/02/the-power-of-curiosity/">The Power of Curiosity</a>) where he states that actions can mainly be thought of as motivated by 2 things: purpose and curiosity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are essentially two different modes of thought you can apply when deciding what to do: purpose and curiosity. Acting through purpose means accomplishing a project or task because you have a known outcome. Writing this article is an act of purpose, I want to update my blog with new content, so I’m writing with the intent of finishing an article.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Curiosity, however, is a more interesting perspective that is often underused. In taking on an activity because of curiosity, you aren’t taking on a task despite an uncertain outcome. You’re taking on a task or project, because the result is uncertain. While acting from purpose comes from the need to achieve something known, curiosity drives us to learn something new.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This drove me to think about how much my actions have been skewed towards purpose more than curiosity &ndash; I studied to pass and get my degree, I worked a bunch of jobs to make a living, etc etc. But I hadn&rsquo;t really been deliberately thinking about how to make space for curiosity and play in my life &ndash; things I do just because I like them. Some people thrive off purpose, but I realise I feel better when I&rsquo;ve made space for something curious and playful, because I am the type that can&rsquo;t really be prodded to do things I don&rsquo;t like. I&rsquo;ve realised that when I am forced to do things I dislike, it is bad for me and anyone else involved.</p>
<p>When it comes to programming, I used to have this frame of mind that placed a lot of pressure on myself to come up with something <em>portfolio-worthy</em>, something that would get me a software engineering job and feel like all the uncertainty etc paid off. It&rsquo;s not the best mindset to have, and continuing to place that pressure on myself would&rsquo;ve killed my will to keep making. I realise that there&rsquo;s a tradeoff as my history/experience looks very haphazard (re: my 100 days of code log), but I think giving myself the space to just be curious and sniff about like a dog is better in the long run. Right now, I don&rsquo;t have to optimize for getting a SWE job ASAP because I&rsquo;ve already got a day job in legal research that involves some programming, and have enough time in the evenings and weekends to do random stuff I find fun. Sometimes it&rsquo;s trying to fiddle with SimplyGo&rsquo;s website to add up my transactions because they won&rsquo;t do that (idk why), sometimes it&rsquo;s fiddling with p5.js to make little circles.</p>

<p>As a random aside, things seem to become cool when people are deeply interested in them. It&rsquo;s the kind of commitment and deep attention that craftmanship has that makes it fascinating, more so than the actual subject matter. Am I a serious coffee drinker / have opinions about coffee? No. But will I watch James Hoffman look into Nespresso&rsquo;s patents in his review of the Nespresso Vertuo? Yes.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Noting when past beliefs haven&rsquo;t caught up with present reality</strong></p>
<p>It takes a while for attitudes to update. One of the big beliefs I have that isn&rsquo;t really reflective of reality is my scarcity mindset. For a while I felt like I had to work a lot to earn money, and it continued to endure even when those circumstances weren&rsquo;t really present anymore. I felt like I didn&rsquo;t really have options, and that scarcity mindset translated to non-monetary opportunities too where I felt like I should just take on whatever I can get. At some point, I started getting multiple things at once, but hadn&rsquo;t let go of that mindset. This led me to overcommit, underdeliver and kind of fail to be selective about the things I was doing.</p>
<p>We constantly trade our time for various things like convenience or purpose or maintaining our relationships or saving/making money. It&rsquo;s important to make sure our beliefs about where our time should go are up-to-date.</p>
<p>I recently had a chat with a friend about him wanting to do a computer vision side project, but needing a better laptop for it. He could save a few hundred dollars if he bought it when he comes to visit Singapore next year, but it&rsquo;d mean delaying that project by about 3 months.</p>
<p>The question(s) kinda become:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a few hundred dollars worth 3 months that you could&rsquo;ve spent working on your side project? (Question of personal opinion)</li>
<li>In partially deciding the above: Does it take you more than 3 months to make a few hundred dollars? (Factual - answer is no)</li>
</ul>
<p>I often think the same way, so I try to pause whenever I feel seized by this sudden fear and feeling of urgency to save / choose the thing that costs the least and ask myself if it&rsquo;s informed by my current circumstances, or if it&rsquo;s like a reflex that responds to problems that don&rsquo;t exist anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Your time is finite and not all of it is fungible</strong></p>
<p>Our time is finite. As Death says in Vol. 7 (<em>Brief Lives</em>) of The Sandman: &lsquo;You lived what anybody gets, Bernie. You got a lifetime. No more. No less&rsquo;. I have this Chrome extension called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-last-sunday-reminder/aiojhapcgfgmiacbbjfgedhlcchmpelh?hl=en#:~:text=This%20extension%20shows%20you%20a,name%20and%20date%20of%20birth.">The Last Sunday</a> that counts down how many weeks you have left and displays them whenever you open a new tab, assuming that your lifespan ends at 80. I have 2949 Sundays left at the time of writing.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>As much as the fact that time being finite should make us be more selective with how we spend our time, it also shouldn&rsquo;t invite this toxic urge to treat all time as fungible for work &ndash; like oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t have taken that nap / gone out with friends / done something fun because I could&rsquo;ve been working or studying or Getting Ahead. When you feel tired or bad about yourself, that time is not realistically free for working.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s about it for now. If you&rsquo;ve read this far - I&rsquo;d love to hear what your personal canon is like as I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for new things to read.</p>

<h1 id="context">Context</h1>
<p>I was helping with organising a conference that involved an experiential VR component, where conference participants could try out apps on the Oculus Quest 2. However, one of the applications featured was a game on Steam that had no native Oculus app to install.</p>
<p>This meant that we had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the Oculus app for PC (btw it has no Mac support)</li>
<li>Pair the Oculus with the PC via a wired connection (USB-C) or Air Link (wireless, via WiFi)</li>
<li>Start the game in Steam and choose &ldquo;Launch with Steam VR&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>And the conference was a hybrid conference, so we also had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out how to stream what was happening on the Oculus to Zoom</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-not-just-connect-it-with-a-wired-connection">Why not just connect it with a wired connection?</h2>
<p>We could&rsquo;ve used a wired connection, but there was a concern about the experience being suboptimal (range of movement being limited by the length of the USB-C cable) and also risking participants tripping over wires.</p>
<h2 id="problems-with-air-link-and-knock-on-problems-with-streaming">Problems with Air Link and knock-on problems with streaming</h2>
<p>The PC we were using had no WiFi, and Oculus Air Link needs WiFi to work.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The casting feature in Oculus (not in Air Link/wired mode) lets you show what the Oculus user is seeing if you log in on <a href="https://www.oculus.com/casting/">oculus.com/casting</a> on Chromium browsers, when both the browser&rsquo;s device and the Oculus headset are on the same network. This feature is not available if you&rsquo;re connected to a PC, so you need to find some other way to show what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>For the conference, we were sharing the screen of a monitor that had 5 different Chrome windows logged on to the headsets&rsquo; accounts. The 6th headset was the one that was linked to a PC, that couldn&rsquo;t be shown with the same method.</p>
<h2 id="solutionwhat-we-ended-up-doing-wifi-adapter--obs-virtual-camera">Solution/What We Ended Up Doing: WiFi Adapter + OBS Virtual Camera</h2>
<ol>
<li>Acquire WiFi Adapter (We used an <a href="https://www.edimax.com/edimax/merchandise/merchandise_detail/data/edimax/global/wireless_adapters_ac1750_dual-band/ew-7833uac">Edimax AC1750</a>)</li>
<li>Set it up - install driver and whatnot</li>
<li>Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Mobile hotspot</li>
<li>Turn on Mobile Hotspot</li>
<li>Connect your Oculus headset to the PC&rsquo;s hotspot</li>
<li>Turn on Airlink -&gt; select your PC from the list of devices -&gt; click Launch</li>
<li>Launch your Steam game with Steam VR</li>
<li>Use OBS Virtual Camera to do Window Capture of the Steam game&rsquo;s window, then Start Virtual Camera</li>
<li>Join Zoom Meeting and change camera output to OBS Camera</li>

<p>This project involved some really tight timelines, so I was really just doing stuff manually (i.e. copy-pasting and tweaking things slightly) because it took less effort than thinking through how to add props and make a component reusable.

<p>I debugged something with a coworker today, which was nice. A html element wasn&rsquo;t showing up on a Shopify dev store page (e.g. instead of (0/6) it&rsquo;d just show (0/ )), and we were trying to figure out why. We compared the HTML of the live store versus the dev store and realised that the value attribute of that element on the dev store was missing altogether. After digging into the Liquid file that the page was generated from, we realised that the value attribute was retrieving its value from an object (a Shopify metafield &ndash; like product.metafields.namespace.key) that didn&rsquo;t exist on the dev store, as it wasn&rsquo;t copied over when we copied products over to the dev store. Thinking out loud, figuring out the bug and fixing it together was quite fun.</p>
<p>Also had to work more with Liquid today as I was changing a template for invoices.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>day 16</title><link>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-07-19-day-16/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-07-19-day-16/</guid><description>&lt;p>Using .filter(), and thinking about reusable components&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using .filter(), and thinking about reusable components</p>

<p>Attended a talk today that featured a software engineer who had no formal CS background, which was pretty heartening. She mentioned a really good way of thinking about your career, namely the importance of developing these 4 things: skillset (functional, conscious competence), mindset (self beliefs and self-awareness), teamwork, and network (influence and relationships). A lot of software engineering comprises of things that aren&rsquo;t just your technical skill (unless you&rsquo;re some kind of very monastic individual contributor who never has to interact with people).</p>
<p>Now that COVID measures are easing up a bit, I&rsquo;m trying to push myself to attend more meetups and meet new people. I was incredibly nervous at my first meetup and probably committed some kind of social faux pas, but never mind. It&rsquo;ll get better with practice.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>day 10</title><link>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-16-day-10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-16-day-10/</guid><description>&lt;p>Flexbox shenanigans!&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flexbox shenanigans!</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">Flexbox Froggy</a></strong> &ndash; completed this today!  it&rsquo;s a great resource that teaches you about the differences between various properties that work with flex, like align-content and align-items. Highly recommend. Doesn&rsquo;t take long to complete.</p>
<p><strong>Volunteering project</strong>: Got a component to take JSON data (messages) from an API, set state and use the state to generate divs for each message. So if there are 5 messages, 5 divs are generated. Used media query + flex to display 2 columns only when screen size is above a certain threshold, so that it isn&rsquo;t awfully small on mobile. No demo as it&rsquo;s a private repo :(</p>
<p>Side note: Today&rsquo;s a public holiday and I&rsquo;m glad I managed to sit down for 1.5h to focus on learning the stuff needed to build my component. I&rsquo;m usually very drained on other days as I have to be out of the house.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>day 9</title><link>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-15-day-9/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-15-day-9/</guid><description>&lt;p>More working with objects: Object.keys(obj) and &lt;code>for (let item in items)&lt;/code>on freecodecamp.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More working with objects: Object.keys(obj) and <code>for (let item in items)</code>on freecodecamp.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been pretty tired lately but I&rsquo;m glad that I made a bit of time (45 minutes) today to learn something new for my own interest, as opposed to learning something for my paid work (I guess it can improve my work, but it&rsquo;s not a very direct benefit considering that I&rsquo;m doing more of working with third party apps on Shopify and troubleshooting them). That was fun. I&rsquo;m trying to get out of the mindset that I need to have particularly noteworthy things to talk about every day, and just focus on building up <em>consistency</em> &ndash; any daily exercise/learning is good learning and any post is a good post. The main point is to be more consistent, and trust the process a bit more.</p>
<p>Method of the day: .splice()
.splice() takes in 3 params: the starting index, number of items to remove, and what to replace the starting index&rsquo;s contents with.<br>
Besides modifying the array that it is used on, it also returns an array containing the items that have been removed</p>
<p>Example:
Take that we let arr = [&lsquo;We&rsquo;, &lsquo;are&rsquo;, &rsquo;looking&rsquo;, &lsquo;for&rsquo;, &lsquo;Blue's&rsquo;, &lsquo;Clues&rsquo;]</p>
<p>arr.splice(3, 3) would remove arr[3], arr[4] and arr[5] from arr, and return an array containing those 3 removed elements.</p>
<p>arr.splice(3, 3, &lsquo;young&rsquo;) would remove the 3 items mentioned above but also replace them with &lsquo;young&rsquo; at index 3 in the original arr to give us &ldquo;We are looking young&rdquo;, while returning an array containing the 3 removed elements.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>day 7</title><link>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-13-day-7/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-13-day-7/</guid><description>&lt;p>Starting to think about whether this site is accessible, how to test if it is accessible, and how to make it accessible if it isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting to think about whether this site is accessible, how to test if it is accessible, and how to make it accessible if it isn&rsquo;t</p>
<h1 id="thinking-about-my-personal-sites-accessibility">Thinking about my personal site&rsquo;s accessibility</h1>
<p>I attended a StackX meetup yesterday and decided to poke about GovTech&rsquo;s github repos. Seeing the SGDS provoked me to think about <em>my</em> own site&rsquo;s accessibility. There&rsquo;s some tech debt in the sense that I&rsquo;m using Jekyll, and need to figure out how the html in my site is generated. If I were coding everything by myself with HTML+CSS+JS, it&rsquo;d probably be a lot easier to just tweak the site&rsquo;s html directly. So this is the main todo.</p>
<p>Resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.goring.org/resources/accessibility.html">Accessibility with Jekyll Pages</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also finished FreeCodeCamp&rsquo;s regex section, although regex still feels very mind-bending to me. Should look for more exercises so it becomes a matter of muscle memory.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>day 6</title><link>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-10-day-6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-10-day-6/</guid><description>&lt;p>from May 6 - May 10 just a lot of Shopify stuff&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>from May 6 - May 10 just a lot of Shopify stuff</p>
<h1 id="shopify">Shopify</h1>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been spending most of my time familiarising myself with Shopify because of work. My tasks can generally be grouped into the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Theme customisation</li>
<li>Updating information (like product tags / changing HTML templates for certain pages)</li>
<li>Writing tests &ndash; I&rsquo;m learning to use UI-licious to automate testing of stores&rsquo; Uis</li>
<li>Working with Shopify&rsquo;s third party apps for doing a variety of things, like setting up logic for shipping, build-your-own-box products, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to spend some time outside of work becoming more familiar with Liquid and the structure of Shopify themes so that I can do more complex customisation work. There&rsquo;s also some really cool-looking stuff like Hydrogen (Shopify&rsquo;s framework for building custom storefronts) that I want to explore. In this vein, I&rsquo;ve signed up for a Udemy course to learn how to make themes (esp learning how to use the Shopify CLI, Liquid, Tailwind and also the JSON templates that themes have).</p>
<h1 id="soft-skills-and-learning-about-my-own-preferences">Soft skills and learning about my own preferences</h1>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve learnt lately is that I don&rsquo;t really enjoy meetings. I&rsquo;m on a contract to do about 20h of work a week, but find that meetings (standups, client meetings etc) tend to take close to 20% of that time, which is a lot of time to me. Moving forward, I&rsquo;m going to try to not attend client meetings where my presence is just good to have but not actually necessary. However, since I&rsquo;m new, I&rsquo;m going to treat these meetings like part of the necessary learning curve to get to know clients&rsquo; usual pain points and what features they tend to need.</p>
<p>Coming to my own preferences &ndash; I realised that when I look for full-time dev opportuntiies, I&rsquo;d prefer to work on things that have a longer time frame. Ideally, this would be a company where devs build the company&rsquo;s own product as opposed to having to answer to external clients. With agency work, meetings can be last minute as unexpected problems crop up (e.g. client reports that some feature of their site is down and it&rsquo;s an important) quite often. I enjoy more long-term, less urgent work that I can do asynchronously most of the time. I think that&rsquo;s why I liked my undergrad research jobs so much, because it&rsquo;s about chipping away at this One Project until it&rsquo;s done. There also aren&rsquo;t a lot of meetings or last-minute requests.</p>
<h1 id="setting-boundaries">Setting boundaries</h1>
<p>Working as a freelancer for an agency has really tested my ability to set boundaries, mostly because I have an overextended sense of responsibility. Like, when someone asks me &ldquo;Can you do this by tomorrow&rdquo;, I think of it as &ldquo;Can I do this if I stay up late&rdquo; and tend to say yes if I think it is physically possible to do it, and not so much of whether I <em>should</em> be exerting myself to that point where I&rsquo;m up till 1 working on something.</p>
<p>This is an issue to do with setting boundaries, and I think it&rsquo;s time for me to properly set some. I will keep myself available in the day for work, but won&rsquo;t do it after 5pm because I&rsquo;ve got other parts of my life to tend to. If I keep responding to people&rsquo;s requests whenever they come in, it means I&rsquo;m living a lot less of my life. My contract is for 4 hours a day, but quite a lot of time goes to things outside of dev work like doing time tracking, responding to colleagues etc, client meetings that aren&rsquo;t always billable.</p>
<p>These boundaries are important because I realised that I&rsquo;ve not been focusing much on my own learning and growth for things outside of stuff related to my paid work &ndash; e.g. learning data structures and algorithms, learning more about backend.</p>
<h1 id="random-update-some-free-camp">Random update: some free camp</h1>
<p>I signed up for this -redacted tech company - Youth Camp thing that involves 2-3h classes every weekday from last Wednesday to this Friday (run by SWEs from that company), but am realising that it&rsquo;s not for me. 2-3h hours every weekday on top of work is making me way more tired than I expected. I also don&rsquo;t fare well with long lectures. I&rsquo;ll look for this sort of thing and vet the opportunities I want to sign up for more judiciously in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>day 5???</title><link>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-06-day-5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-06-day-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>Falling off the face of the earth; drinking from a firehose.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Falling off the face of the earth; drinking from a firehose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been more than a week. I&rsquo;m definitely not fantastic at staying updated &ndash; honestly each day is more of &ldquo;a day where I remembered to document what I was doing&rdquo;. I think 100daysofcode is a nice guide and symbol of consistency, but it&rsquo;s not something that I can realistically do. Some days, you just need a clean break from coding. And that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<h1 id="drinking-from-the-firehose">Drinking from the firehose</h1>
<p>But anyway, the past week has felt like a blender. I started working on the frontend for a volunteer project, and had to touch React for the first time (or maybe the 1.5th time). Working with another volunteer (a much more experienced dev who I&rsquo;ve never met and whose actual identity I have no clue of - such is the internet :P) who wrote the backend meant that I had to figure out how to work with Flask (to test locally), and also set up Node. They wanted me to get some experience deploying apps and dealing with real world concerns like load balancing, but I haven&rsquo;t managed to get it up yet&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="shes-in-her-freelance-era">She&rsquo;s in her freelance era</h1>
<p>On 4 May, Wednesday, I started my first day of working for a web design + dev agency that focuses on Shopify sites. I&rsquo;ve never touched Shopify in my life (besides checking things out). I&rsquo;m learning to accept the discomfort of starting a new job, learning a whole new set of norms + tech stack for managing work + syntax (Shopify does use Liquid [ok actually they made it], which I have touched a little bit because Jekyll uses it too). I&rsquo;m blundering and hopefully reducing my learning:doing ratio (in favour of spending more time doing) over time. But anyway, it&rsquo;s 4 hours a day and pays me twice as much as any of my law internships ever did (which is more of a testament to how poorly law interns are paid).</p>
<h1 id="changing-lanes">Changing lanes</h1>
<p>After finishing 4 years of university, picking up this freelance thing felt like the first step in confirming my change of paths. I studied law, but won&rsquo;t be practicing as a lawyer as I genuinely don&rsquo;t think I can hack it. Some people can handle constant stress and 12-hour days, but not me. I&rsquo;ve got other priorities like my health and possible family caregiving stuff.</p>
<p>Ideally, I&rsquo;ll be able to do dev work that also taps on my legal training &ndash; like building tools for legal ecosystem folks (research, practice managements, blahblah). But for now, I&rsquo;m just going to focus on getting my foot in the door, feeding myself, and learning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of shame associated with not doing what you were trained for, but it&rsquo;s kind of natural to change. Optimistically viewed, it means that my time in university was genuinely transformative. I&rsquo;m a very different person from my 19 year old self now. The version of me 4 years from now will also probably feel like a whole different person.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>day 4</title><link>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-04-25-day-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-04-25-day-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Not much from me today.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not much from me today.</p>

<h1 id="website-improvements">Website Improvements</h1>
<p>I was very happy about finally mapping my domain, but then realised it&rsquo;d return a 404 whenever i try to access tomoe.asia after pushing new changes and deploying.</p>
<p>When you go to your Github Pages site repo &gt; Settings &gt; Pages and type in a custom domain for github pages, it creates this CNAME file in the root of your repo. However, it turns out that static site generators (like Jekyll) can force push changes, which can overwrite the CNAME file (haven&rsquo;t figured out how exactly it works), which affects whether tomoe.asia resolves to get the content of my site. That was why tomoe.asia wouldn&rsquo;t work after I push changes and publish my site.</p>
