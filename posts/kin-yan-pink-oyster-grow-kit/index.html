At that point in time, I was still in my tomato obsession phase but found it interesting enough to snap a photo to remember. Lucky are those who live in Sussex.\nThis got me thinking about whether I could grow my own mushrooms, and how such a process even happens.\nBrief fungi facts Mushrooms are just one part of the fungus. They’re formed from hyphae (which are small rope-like structures that make up most of fungi). The network of hyphae - the mycelium - grows throughout the soil or whatever substrate they have colonised.\nFor instance, the largest organism on Earth is an Armillaria ostoyae that occupies roughly 10 square kilometers.\nMushrooms can pop up in the same spot for years as long as the underlying mycelium is sill there.\nWhat it means when we get a grow kit A grow kit is essentially a block of fully colonised substrate that has been taken over by the mycelium and is now ready for fruiting (i.e. growing mushrooms). People who want to get more involved in the mushroom cultivation process may create their own substrates and wait for the mycelium to colonise it.\nThere are several mushroom grow kit providers in Singapore such as Bewilder, Kin Yan Agrotech, Fogo Fungi and Mushroom Kingdom. I decided to get the Kin Yan Pink Oyster kit on Shopee as it was the only kit that appeared to be in stock at the time.\nGrowing process It took about 5 days between receiving my kit and harvesting my first flush of mushrooms.\nDay 0 (12 Sep 2024) The instructions on the kit said to cut an X through the plastic and to spray the block with water 3 times a day (the kit came with a small mister).\nThe reason we need to do this is that the Pink Oyster Mushroom (pleurotus djamor) has a pinning humidity of 95%.\nI also scratched part of the surface with a fork as some websites recommended that for their grow kits, but I didn’t really see how it affected mushroom growth at all.\nDay 3 (15 Sep 2024) Little pins start to appear after what felt like 3 days of pointless misting.\nThe “pinning humidity” mentioned earlier refers to the humidity needed to trigger mushroom development. There are some slight differences between mushroom primordia and pins, but they’re both stages that occur before the mushroom properly fruits. For more about stages of mushroom growth, check this out.\nDay 4 (16 Sep 2024) They grow up so fast. For oyster mushrooms, these two things matter a lot:\nFresh Air Exchange (place your shrooms in a well-ventilated area) Humidity The humidity needed for fruiting is lower than that of pinning. Pleurotus djamor fruits at around 85-90% humidity.\nDue to Singapore’s humidity (which hovers around the mid-80s), I got away with being less diligent about misting (I only really misted twice a day). If you are in a less humid area, you may need to create a humidity tent for your mushrooms.\nDay 5 (17 Sep 2024) - 150g First harvest! The mushrooms on my kit grew quite unevenly, so I decided to harvest some on this day and some on the next day.\nThis was what they looked like in the morning on the 17th.\nI harvested my first round around 11pm that night and got 150g of mushrooms.\nAfter harvesting, I put them in a paper bag lined with some paper towels to absorb moisture.\nDay 6 (18 Sep 2024) - 140g I decided to harvest the rest of the mushrooms a day later, but later regretted that decision.\nI got about 140g from this harvest. The mushrooms I harvested a day later were less pink, and had more ruffled gills. They were still edible, but not as tender as the mushrooms I harvested the day before.\nFor a clearer comparison, I took a photo of them side by side:\nKeeping the grow kit going Each grow kit can yield multiple flushes of mushrooms. The grow kit’s instructions said to cut another X on the back of the kit, but I personally found that the mushrooms continued growing along the edges of old growth.\nI continued spraying the grow kit to keep it moist.\nCooking the mushrooms + subsequent harvests After trying pink oyster mushrooms in tomato hotpot and in stir-fries, my sense is that they are best when fried till crispy with some garlic and butter.\nPink oyster mushrooms get described as ham/bacon-adjacent. They don’t taste exactly like that, but I would say that’s the closest flavour that approximates a pink oyster mushroom before you actually try one.\nThe mushroom yield per flush diminishes over time as the substrate’s nutrients get used up. Interestingly, my mushrooms after the first flush were all white instead of pink. I’m not sure about what caused the change.\nHere are some of the subsequent flushes and the dishes that were made with them.\n12 Oct 2024 - 30g, omelette with chives and mushroom I gave these to Sroyon and his friend (packaged in an old yogurt container).\nThey turned it an omelette with chives and mushroom that was part of a very tasty lunch spread =)\nPhoto credits to Sroyon!\n9 Nov 2024 - 10g, mushroom palak paneer The final round was quite sad. I went to my friend’s place to learn how to make daal and palak paneer, but didn’t have enough mushrooms for them to constitute their own dish.\nWe ended up tearing the mushrooms into shreds, and threw them into the palak paneer to cook. This ended up being surprisingly good as the mushrooms soaked up the flavour of the sauce while remaining somewhat toothsome and chewy.\nOur meal :D\nWhat I’ve done with my used-up grow kit I’ve crumbled up part of my mushroom kit to mix into soil as mushroom compost can improve moisture retention - but be careful to avoid using it on acid-loving plants as mushroom compost is slightly alkaline.\nI’ve also crumbled up part of the kit to mix with coffee grounds and cardboard to see if it’ll continue growing.\nWas this cheaper than the same thing at the supermarket? The kit cost me SGD14.40 (while it was on sale). I got about 330g of mushrooms from September to November. Pink oyster mushrooms from the same farm – Kin Yan Agrotech – costs SGD3.34 for 130g. For 330g of mushrooms, it would’ve cost me SGD8.47 to buy it from the supermarket.\nIn that sense, it probably wasn’t worth it. However, I’d say that the entertainment value of getting to cook some freshly grown mushrooms was worth more than the difference in price. It’s also hard to compare mushrooms that I’ve just picked off my own kit vs ones that’ve been packed and delivered to the supermarket.\n(Is this delusional coping? Probably.)\n","wordCount":"1159","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-11-25T18:32:25+08:00","dateModified":"2024-11-25T18:32:25+08:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://tomoe.asia/posts/kin-yan-pink-oyster-grow-kit/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"nondescryptid","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dezwnhp01/image/upload/v1690391047/pixeltree.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://tomoe.asia accesskey=h title="nondescryptid (Alt + H)">nondescryptid</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://tomoe.asia/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tomoe.asia/archives/ title=Archives><span>Archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tomoe.asia/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tomoe.asia/search title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tomoe.asia/lol title=LOL><span>LOL</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Growing pink oyster mushrooms from a Kin Yan Agrotech grow kit (unabridged)</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-11-25 18:32:25 +0800 +0800'>November 25, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min</div></header><div class=post-content><p>While walking around sometime in June, I saw a flyer for All Things Fungi - a festival about, well, all things fungi.
