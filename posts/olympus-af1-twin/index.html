I take note of this because some cameras have incredibly convoluted steps for disabling flash – the Fuji Zoom Cardia Super 115 requires you to press the flash button 6 times before you can take a photo without flash. The AF-1 Twin is very straightforward in comparison.\nI enjoy the mechanism where you slide the lens cover to turn on the camera. As a clumsy person, I think this would survive being thrown into my backpack. Cameras that are powered by buttons sometimes end up turning on while they’re in my bag (horror).\nThe lens cover of the one I got seemed to have a lot of friction, so I pried off the cover, starting from the bottom.
