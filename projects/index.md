- stack: vue, express+objection, node
- [github repo here](https://github.com/TechLadies/irrc-madwish). the link for this project above leads to a partial mirror of the actual web app (access is restricted). only the front-end is up right now -- back-end will be deployed when I have the time and feel like it.
