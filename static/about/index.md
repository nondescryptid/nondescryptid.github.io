Welcome to the longer version of my introduction -- it's written like an FAQ to address stuff that's come up at events I've gone for (or people I've bumped into). Whenever I go for a developer meetup, people are slightly taken aback when I say I work in a law school. LOL.

**What did you do in school?**

I studied law in undergrad, but am working in legal research at the National University of Singapore's technology & law centre instead of practicing law. 

**What're you interested in (and perhaps good at)?**

I like improving processes, communicating technical concepts clearly and learning to code. I'm more introverted by nature but can talk to people if I really need to. My kiddo part-time jobs were good training - worked at Ce La Vi (one of the bars on top of Marina Bay Sands) and also sold some nice but overpriced bath bombs at LUSH.


**How did you realise you liked those things?**

Dabbled in a bunch of things throughout university, and realised the things that were the most satisfying were: 
- creating a standard procedure + flowchart for handling and triaging calls from migrant domestic workers for Justice Without Borders;
- researching + designing a one-page infographic on matrimonial asset division for the Legal Aid Bureau
- building a web app for matching volunteer teachers and students as part of TechLadies
- writing a piece to explain the different types of network effects, and how they've been historically assessed in merger cases in the EU

**How did you start programming? / What's the journey been like?**

This is going to be a very convoluted story. I first touched Scratch (via CS50) in 2018, when I was in this "internship" at a law firm that turned out to be more of a "let's hire a bunch of fairly naive and eager students to do billing for clients for the equivalent of $3.30/h" thing. It was uniquely depressing, and I had a kind of quiet reverence for whoever from IT cooked up an Excel macro that made generating timesheets less painful. I figured that if I want to avoid this kind of mind-numbing and soul-killing stuff, I should probably learn to code. 

So I started CS50, but didn't actually finish it -- I dropped out after pset 4 when uni started. But I hadn't given up on programming altogether as I still tried to get involved in a variety of random ways, like going for NUS Hackers' events (highly recommend - met some great friends on the bus back to my dorm from the first event I went to) or cold-emailing the convenor of one of the introductory CS courses to get access to the materials. Yet again, I didn't actually complete the course as I was floundering academically w.r.t my actual degree.

2018-2020 was kind of demoralising as I was repeatedly taking Ls with regard to progressing in my skills as a programmer, and felt very uncertain about whether this was an interest that would endure. But I still kept at it as I realised I enjoyed even the difficult parts. I felt engaged and (weirdly enough) happy -- even while debugging -- in a way that I rarely felt with my degree.

I think a major point in a beginner developer's character arc is when you get the confidence that you can learn something, even if you can't do it right now. Like, *I don't know this* isn't *I don't know this forever*, but more of *I don't know this **yet***. This feeling only really came after I took part in the TechLadies part-time bootcamp where we'd pair with our mentors every Saturday from 10am-3pm (but often till 5pm) from Sep 2020 - May 2021. I was doing this during the semester and realised that after all that, I was still interested and curious about learning more. More importantly, I felt like I was *able* to learn in a way that I didn't believe about myself before.

I kinda spent a lot of time in dev purgatory though, where I wasn't really making projects. My take is that getting out of dev purgatory / tutorial hell doesn't just take better programming skills, but also involves cultivating a certain worldview where you pay deeper attention to small dissatisfactions/friction (e.g. the random "I wish ...") and find a way to act on it. Think I can only say that I've been working on my own projects in earnest (besides my personal site) since September 2022.

I feel a need to give more details about my experience because there's a lot of content out there that's demoralising as hell for people who take longer to learn -- i.e. the ones along the lines of "I got a job as a SWE within 3 months / a year". The dangerous thing is when people feel that they need to operate on that kind of timeline in order to be deemed Truly Cut Out For It, which is just not true. Treating coding as a hobby more than something instrumental might be the approach if you find that the more job-oriented approach hasn't worked. It worked for me. I've taken a long time and it's ok, because it's something I like doing anyway. Time spent doing something you like is never wasted. 

**What's it like to work with you?**

I'm either really driven or I'm not. I've realised that it's bad for me to do things I'm not interested in, because it's bad for me and everyone involved. I'm not very motivated by much besides my own personal curiosity, so deadlines and extrinsic pressure kind of... don't do much. But my sense of loyalty and desire to help others out helps me to overcome my own lack of interest sometimes.

The upside is that when I truly want something done, it will happen. I am sufficiently stubborn and resourceful in those situations to overcome barriers like my general awkwardness (e.g. with cold-emailing or meeting strangers).

I communicate very directly about goals / plans / intentions / purpose as I personally struggle to understand these things if they're not spelled out. I cannot survive in a place that requires mind-reading, or adherence to unspoken expectations.
