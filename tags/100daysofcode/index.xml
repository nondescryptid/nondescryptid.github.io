<p>TL;DR I set up a Docassemble instance using the <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/practical-guide-docassemble/setup-server">Suffolk LIT Lab Legal Tech Class textbook</a> (written by Quinten Steenhuis &amp; other contributors), with AWS Lightsail and S3. You can check it out at <a href="https://docassemble.tomoe.asia">docassemble.tomoe.asia</a>. Do back up your docassemble interviews though, because I might not pay for this Lightsail instance forever. :P</p>
<p>Instead of setting up a nice sensible local install, I decided that I might as well try to learn how to use AWS before my free AWS credits from one of the JuniorDev meetups expired.</p>
<p>As usual, setting things up is never straightforward, but here are the things I&rsquo;ve learnt to pay more attention to (in decreasing order of significance):</p>
<h1 id="1-learning-how-to-isolate-a-problem">1. Learning how to isolate a problem.</h1>
<p>I could not, for the life of me, access my server at the start. Nothing was loading when I accessed the address I&rsquo;d mapped to it. Logging is an important part of the troubleshooting process as finding out what exactly is going on helps to locate the problem.</p>
<h1 id="2-logs-as-the-first-port-of-call">2. Logs as the first port of call</h1>
<p>To get some sense of what&rsquo;s going on, referring to Docassemble&rsquo;s documentation helped a lot as it provided advice on <a href="https://docassemble.org/docs/docker.html#troubleshooting">troubleshooting through viewing logs</a></p>
<p>After logging the <code>initialize</code> process, I realised that it could not connect to my AWS S3 endpoint URL.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/debugging-doc-initialize.png" alt="Logs for initialization process"  />
</p>
<p>This is where I realised that I had a typo in my env.list file, where I&rsquo;d typed my server region (ap-southeast-1a) instead of my S3 region (ap-southeast-1). Typos have material consequences here, sometimes more so than law.</p>
<h1 id="3-solving-one-problem-sometimes-means-paving-the-way-to-find-another-one">3. Solving one problem sometimes means paving the way to find another one.</h1>
<p>After I fixed my env.list config blunder, I checked the logs and everything seemed to be fine (appropriate processes were running/terminated). However, accessing docassemble.tomoe.asia still wasn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>Why ?????</p>
<p>To locate the (new) problem, I had to recognise that there are at least 2 points of failure:</p>
<ol>
<li>The docassemble instance itself</li>
<li>Connecting the docassemble instance to a domain name</li>
</ol>
<p>I realised it was (2) after I successfully accessed the site with my static IP address. I can&rsquo;t remember what exactly I did to fix it though, but I remember it&rsquo;s where the problem was.</p>
<h1 id="4-silly-mistakes-will-happen-so-just-have-a-good-sense-of-humour-about-it-but-also-remember-to-fix-them">4. Silly mistakes will happen, so just have a good sense of humour about it (but also remember to fix them)</h1>
<p>After the env.list blunder, something new happened while I was trying to add a HTTPS connection (so I don&rsquo;t look like a scammer when friends try my server and are told that their connection is not secure). I was setting stuff up with Let&rsquo;s Encrypt, but HTTPS wasn&rsquo;t happening.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no particular method to this, but after staring at the Suffolk LIT guide, I realised that I had accidentally skipped a step in enabling HTTPS connections for my IPv4 Firewall. ðŸ¤¡</p>
<p>Sometimes, trying to do things while my eyes are dry and tired means that I skip crucial steps. I will try not to deploy things at 2 in the morning and instead learn to stop, and carry on the next day. <strong>I have to accept that I cannot solve every problem I face in one sitting.</strong> This will become more true as the size and complexity of problems I face increases. If I can solve every problem in one sitting, it means that I&rsquo;m probably not pushing my limits in terms of seeking out harder problems to solve.</p>

<p><strong>(2) Making the header sticky</strong></p>
<p>This was less straightforward than I thought it would be. Making the header itself sticky was relatively simple as the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_sticky_element.asp"><code>position</code> property has a <code>sticky</code> attribute</a>. However, a new problem arose where I realised that the Filter section is inside a container (CardContainer.js). I put the cards and filter in the same file as it&rsquo;s easy to setState for search and filtering. However, I now need to make the Filter section its own component, so that I can add it to the header instead, such that the filter section persists while people are scrolling.</p>
<p>Currently, the filter section behaves like this, which is ugly and also not user-friendly:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/sticky-scroll.gif" alt="GIF showing problems with a sticky div within another div"  />
</p>
<p>I find my understanding of React very rudimentary &ndash; I know enough about it to get things to work, but I&rsquo;m not at the level where I understand all the different approaches to managing State and what exactly the best practices are. However, I can always build on this project by refactoring it when I learn of a better way to do things, so that&rsquo;s cool. Incremental learning!</p>
<p>More to-dos / feature wishlist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate routes for individual papers, so that they can be shared with others. Otherwise it&rsquo;ll just be emnlp2022.tomoe.asia &ndash; there&rsquo;s no way to uniquely identify these resources</li>
<li>Allow users to remove saved papers</li>
</ul>
<p>I also fiddled about with my syntax highlighter for the site today, so apologies if it looks janky :P</p>

<p><strong>Server-side rendering v client-side rendering</strong>
This issue exists due to a difference between server and client-side rendering (Next.js uses server-side rendering). localStorage is available as part of the browser API which only exists on the client&rsquo;s browser. This is something I don&rsquo;t entirely understand <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but I resolved this issue by getting items from localStorage within the useEffect() hook thanks to this article: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-localstorage-with-react-hooks-to-set-and-get-items/">How to Use localStorage with React Hooks to Set and Get Items</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Updating saved papers from the individual card components</strong></p>
<p>My web app has 2 main components when it comes to showing cards (containing details about papers):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>CardContainer.js (Parent)
|
|- Card.js (Child)
</code></pre><p>CardContainer contains the array of papers from EMNLP&rsquo;s Excel sheet, and maps each of these papers to a corresponding Card component. It also contains the array of papers that have been saved in localStorage.</p>
<p>However, the act of &ldquo;saving&rdquo; occurs when one clicks on the &ldquo;Save&rdquo; button in a Card component. Then, how do I update CardContainer&rsquo;s (parent) state from the Card (child) component?</p>
<p>After checking out bobbyhadz&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/react-pass-function-as-prop#:~:text=Define%20the%20function%20in%20the,function%20in%20the%20child%20component.">How to pass a Function as props in React</a>&rdquo;, I passed my CardContainer&rsquo;s setSaved() function as a prop into the Card component:</p>
<p>CardContainer:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>    const [savedPapers, setSaved] = useState([])
    ...
    papers.map(paper =&gt; (&lt;Card paper={paper} setSaved={setSaved}/&gt;
</code></pre><p>Card:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>const Card = ({paper, setSaved}) =&gt; {
    ...
    function savePaper(){
        setSaved(items =&gt; [...items, paper])
    }
    return (
        &lt;&gt; {paper &amp;&amp;  &lt;div className={styles.card}&gt;
        &lt;button onClick={savePaper}&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt;
}
</code></pre><p>I used a spread operator to create a copy of the existing array into a new array where I can add other elements. This works, but I wonder if I should just try passing the entire &ldquo;Saved&rdquo; array as a prop and then .push() to it. I used this current solution as I didn&rsquo;t feel like adding another prop, but that&rsquo;s not really a technically informed choice&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Progress/Reflections:</strong></p>
<p>Papers can now be saved, but the UI isn&rsquo;t very user-friendly at the moment as there&rsquo;s no feedback on when you&rsquo;re viewing the Saved papers or just browsing the original array of papers. It&rsquo;s possible to deactivate the &ldquo;saved&rdquo; view by clicking &ldquo;View Saved&rdquo; again, but it&rsquo;s not intuitive &ndash; I know how to use this because I wrote it, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be friendly for people who are using it for the first time.</p>
<ul>
<li>I might want to change the &ldquo;View Saved&rdquo; button&rsquo;s text to &ldquo;Return to Browsing&rdquo; when Saved Papers are being shown.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also no validation for duplicate saved papers, so it is possible to show multiples of the same paper in the Saved Papers view by clicking one paper&rsquo;s Save button several times. I should implement validation next.</p>
<p>Also, I think I should use modals for showing abstracts instead of replacing the cards&rsquo; contents on click &ndash; it&rsquo;s not a nice viewing experience on desktop (with 2 columns) and isn&rsquo;t a good utilisation of space as the paper&rsquo;s abstract is contained within the column that the card is in. This means that only half the viewport&rsquo;s being used. :\</p>

Fixed some styling issues by adding text-wrap to my labels for each card, which was causing a horizontal overflow problem on mobile (esp for conference tracks with very long names) earlier on. My div with the filter+search elements was also way outside the viewport, which made me realise that divs don&rsquo;t inherit the dimensions of parents. So I ended up using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/fit-content"><code>fit-content</code></a> to get my <code>div</code> to fit the container. Frontend is fun, but it also makes my head hurt because there are so many kinds of behaviours to learn (don&rsquo;t even mention flexbox / grid).</p>
<p>But anyway, I&rsquo;m glad that it kinda works now. There are a few more things I would like to learn to implement:</p>
<ul>
<li>saving papers, and viewing them with localStorage</li>
<li>chaining multiple filters (e.g. filtering by submission type + track)</li>
<li>allow multi-select for conference tracks, so that I can view several tracks&rsquo; papers at once, as opposed to one track at a time (which is the case with my current dropdown)</li>
<li>automating the generation of unique values for each type of filter (to get the array of conference tracks, I went to some random website that helps you remove duplicates from lists&hellip; not my best moment to be honest). The idea here, I guess, is to create something I can easily use for another kind of entity that I want to view and filter.</li>

This might not work for everyone as I happen to be privileged enough to work from home + have a really understanding supervisor who gives me autonomy regarding work hours and recognises that learning is part of my job.</p>
<p>This month I&rsquo;ve coded on the following days in Oct: a = [6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. The dev console tells me that means it&rsquo;s been 21 days (used a.length because I was too lazy to count it manually). Which means I&rsquo;m almost halfway through the 100 days (in total, not in a row).</p>
<p>I restarted CS50 for 2 main reasons:</p>
<p>(1) closure</p>
<p>Partially to get closure on the fact that it was the first thing I ever touched relating to code, but I never finished it because I was very new and not at a state where I have the kind of will and faith to finish it. But it&rsquo;s been a good month so far &ndash; I&rsquo;ve learnt a lot, and also feel like I can see how I&rsquo;m very different from the kid 4 years ago touching Scratch and C for the first time.</p>
<p>(2) improving my foundations</p>
<p>My data structures &amp; algo knowledge is really weak and I wanted to get a better handle on things like pointers, hash tables. After going through the first 5 weeks of content in C, I can appreciate why they force us to use C &ndash; you&rsquo;ll understand memory allocation and the relevance of linked lists a lot better when you understand the kinds of problems faced by storing stuff in contiguous slots of memory.</p>
<p>Anyway, strongly recommend doing the course. And also would like to remind anyone who&rsquo;s been discouraged by the course that it&rsquo;s okay to take a step back and learn other things, then return to it.</p>
<p>Things work out in the fullness of time.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>day 23</title><link>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-10-05-day-23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-10-05-day-23/</guid><description>Learnt more about Chrome extensions by updating the manifest of a Chrome extension that wasn&amp;rsquo;t working for me.

<p>I debugged something with a coworker today, which was nice. A html element wasn&rsquo;t showing up on a Shopify dev store page (e.g. instead of (0/6) it&rsquo;d just show (0/ )), and we were trying to figure out why. We compared the HTML of the live store versus the dev store and realised that the value attribute of that element on the dev store was missing altogether. After digging into the Liquid file that the page was generated from, we realised that the value attribute was retrieving its value from an object (a Shopify metafield &ndash; like product.metafields.namespace.key) that didn&rsquo;t exist on the dev store, as it wasn&rsquo;t copied over when we copied products over to the dev store. Thinking out loud, figuring out the bug and fixing it together was quite fun.</p>

<p>Attended a talk today that featured a software engineer who had no formal CS background, which was pretty heartening. She mentioned a really good way of thinking about your career, namely the importance of developing these 4 things: skillset (functional, conscious competence), mindset (self beliefs and self-awareness), teamwork, and network (influence and relationships). A lot of software engineering comprises of things that aren&rsquo;t just your technical skill (unless you&rsquo;re some kind of very monastic individual contributor who never has to interact with people).</p>
<p>Now that COVID measures are easing up a bit, I&rsquo;m trying to push myself to attend more meetups and meet new people. I was incredibly nervous at my first meetup and probably committed some kind of social faux pas, but never mind. It&rsquo;ll get better with practice.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>day 10</title><link>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-16-day-10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-16-day-10/</guid><description>&lt;p>Flexbox shenanigans!&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flexbox shenanigans!</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">Flexbox Froggy</a></strong> &ndash; completed this today!  it&rsquo;s a great resource that teaches you about the differences between various properties that work with flex, like align-content and align-items. Highly recommend. Doesn&rsquo;t take long to complete.</p>
<p><strong>Volunteering project</strong>: Got a component to take JSON data (messages) from an API, set state and use the state to generate divs for each message. So if there are 5 messages, 5 divs are generated. Used media query + flex to display 2 columns only when screen size is above a certain threshold, so that it isn&rsquo;t awfully small on mobile. No demo as it&rsquo;s a private repo :(</p>
<p>Side note: Today&rsquo;s a public holiday and I&rsquo;m glad I managed to sit down for 1.5h to focus on learning the stuff needed to build my component. I&rsquo;m usually very drained on other days as I have to be out of the house.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>day 9</title><link>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-15-day-9/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-15-day-9/</guid><description>&lt;p>More working with objects: Object.keys(obj) and &lt;code>for (let item in items)&lt;/code>on freecodecamp.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More working with objects: Object.keys(obj) and <code>for (let item in items)</code>on freecodecamp.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been pretty tired lately but I&rsquo;m glad that I made a bit of time (45 minutes) today to learn something new for my own interest, as opposed to learning something for my paid work (I guess it can improve my work, but it&rsquo;s not a very direct benefit considering that I&rsquo;m doing more of working with third party apps on Shopify and troubleshooting them). That was fun. I&rsquo;m trying to get out of the mindset that I need to have particularly noteworthy things to talk about every day, and just focus on building up <em>consistency</em> &ndash; any daily exercise/learning is good learning and any post is a good post. The main point is to be more consistent, and trust the process a bit more.</p>
<p>Method of the day: .splice()
.splice() takes in 3 params: the starting index, number of items to remove, and what to replace the starting index&rsquo;s contents with.<br>
Besides modifying the array that it is used on, it also returns an array containing the items that have been removed</p>
<p>Example:
Take that we let arr = [&lsquo;We&rsquo;, &lsquo;are&rsquo;, &rsquo;looking&rsquo;, &lsquo;for&rsquo;, &lsquo;Blue's&rsquo;, &lsquo;Clues&rsquo;]</p>
<p>arr.splice(3, 3) would remove arr[3], arr[4] and arr[5] from arr, and return an array containing those 3 removed elements.</p>
<p>arr.splice(3, 3, &lsquo;young&rsquo;) would remove the 3 items mentioned above but also replace them with &lsquo;young&rsquo; at index 3 in the original arr to give us &ldquo;We are looking young&rdquo;, while returning an array containing the 3 removed elements.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>day 7</title><link>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-13-day-7/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-13-day-7/</guid><description>&lt;p>Starting to think about whether this site is accessible, how to test if it is accessible, and how to make it accessible if it isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting to think about whether this site is accessible, how to test if it is accessible, and how to make it accessible if it isn&rsquo;t</p>
<h1 id="thinking-about-my-personal-sites-accessibility">Thinking about my personal site&rsquo;s accessibility</h1>
<p>I attended a StackX meetup yesterday and decided to poke about GovTech&rsquo;s github repos. Seeing the SGDS provoked me to think about <em>my</em> own site&rsquo;s accessibility. There&rsquo;s some tech debt in the sense that I&rsquo;m using Jekyll, and need to figure out how the html in my site is generated. If I were coding everything by myself with HTML+CSS+JS, it&rsquo;d probably be a lot easier to just tweak the site&rsquo;s html directly. So this is the main todo.</p>
<p>Resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.goring.org/resources/accessibility.html">Accessibility with Jekyll Pages</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also finished FreeCodeCamp&rsquo;s regex section, although regex still feels very mind-bending to me. Should look for more exercises so it becomes a matter of muscle memory.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>day 6</title><link>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-10-day-6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-10-day-6/</guid><description>&lt;p>from May 6 - May 10 just a lot of Shopify stuff&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>from May 6 - May 10 just a lot of Shopify stuff</p>
<h1 id="shopify">Shopify</h1>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been spending most of my time familiarising myself with Shopify because of work. My tasks can generally be grouped into the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Theme customisation</li>
<li>Updating information (like product tags / changing HTML templates for certain pages)</li>
<li>Writing tests &ndash; I&rsquo;m learning to use UI-licious to automate testing of stores&rsquo; Uis</li>
<li>Working with Shopify&rsquo;s third party apps for doing a variety of things, like setting up logic for shipping, build-your-own-box products, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to spend some time outside of work becoming more familiar with Liquid and the structure of Shopify themes so that I can do more complex customisation work. There&rsquo;s also some really cool-looking stuff like Hydrogen (Shopify&rsquo;s framework for building custom storefronts) that I want to explore. In this vein, I&rsquo;ve signed up for a Udemy course to learn how to make themes (esp learning how to use the Shopify CLI, Liquid, Tailwind and also the JSON templates that themes have).</p>
<h1 id="soft-skills-and-learning-about-my-own-preferences">Soft skills and learning about my own preferences</h1>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve learnt lately is that I don&rsquo;t really enjoy meetings. I&rsquo;m on a contract to do about 20h of work a week, but find that meetings (standups, client meetings etc) tend to take close to 20% of that time, which is a lot of time to me. Moving forward, I&rsquo;m going to try to not attend client meetings where my presence is just good to have but not actually necessary. However, since I&rsquo;m new, I&rsquo;m going to treat these meetings like part of the necessary learning curve to get to know clients&rsquo; usual pain points and what features they tend to need.</p>
<p>Coming to my own preferences &ndash; I realised that when I look for full-time dev opportuntiies, I&rsquo;d prefer to work on things that have a longer time frame. Ideally, this would be a company where devs build the company&rsquo;s own product as opposed to having to answer to external clients. With agency work, meetings can be last minute as unexpected problems crop up (e.g. client reports that some feature of their site is down and it&rsquo;s an important) quite often. I enjoy more long-term, less urgent work that I can do asynchronously most of the time. I think that&rsquo;s why I liked my undergrad research jobs so much, because it&rsquo;s about chipping away at this One Project until it&rsquo;s done. There also aren&rsquo;t a lot of meetings or last-minute requests.</p>
<h1 id="setting-boundaries">Setting boundaries</h1>
<p>Working as a freelancer for an agency has really tested my ability to set boundaries, mostly because I have an overextended sense of responsibility. Like, when someone asks me &ldquo;Can you do this by tomorrow&rdquo;, I think of it as &ldquo;Can I do this if I stay up late&rdquo; and tend to say yes if I think it is physically possible to do it, and not so much of whether I <em>should</em> be exerting myself to that point where I&rsquo;m up till 1 working on something.</p>
<p>This is an issue to do with setting boundaries, and I think it&rsquo;s time for me to properly set some. I will keep myself available in the day for work, but won&rsquo;t do it after 5pm because I&rsquo;ve got other parts of my life to tend to. If I keep responding to people&rsquo;s requests whenever they come in, it means I&rsquo;m living a lot less of my life. My contract is for 4 hours a day, but quite a lot of time goes to things outside of dev work like doing time tracking, responding to colleagues etc, client meetings that aren&rsquo;t always billable.</p>
<p>These boundaries are important because I realised that I&rsquo;ve not been focusing much on my own learning and growth for things outside of stuff related to my paid work &ndash; e.g. learning data structures and algorithms, learning more about backend.</p>
<h1 id="random-update-some-free-camp">Random update: some free camp</h1>
<p>I signed up for this -redacted tech company - Youth Camp thing that involves 2-3h classes every weekday from last Wednesday to this Friday (run by SWEs from that company), but am realising that it&rsquo;s not for me. 2-3h hours every weekday on top of work is making me way more tired than I expected. I also don&rsquo;t fare well with long lectures. I&rsquo;ll look for this sort of thing and vet the opportunities I want to sign up for more judiciously in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>day 5???</title><link>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-06-day-5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-05-06-day-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>Falling off the face of the earth; drinking from a firehose.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Falling off the face of the earth; drinking from a firehose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been more than a week. I&rsquo;m definitely not fantastic at staying updated &ndash; honestly each day is more of &ldquo;a day where I remembered to document what I was doing&rdquo;. I think 100daysofcode is a nice guide and symbol of consistency, but it&rsquo;s not something that I can realistically do. Some days, you just need a clean break from coding. And that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<h1 id="drinking-from-the-firehose">Drinking from the firehose</h1>
<p>But anyway, the past week has felt like a blender. I started working on the frontend for a volunteer project, and had to touch React for the first time (or maybe the 1.5th time). Working with another volunteer (a much more experienced dev who I&rsquo;ve never met and whose actual identity I have no clue of - such is the internet :P) who wrote the backend meant that I had to figure out how to work with Flask (to test locally), and also set up Node. They wanted me to get some experience deploying apps and dealing with real world concerns like load balancing, but I haven&rsquo;t managed to get it up yet&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="shes-in-her-freelance-era">She&rsquo;s in her freelance era</h1>
<p>On 4 May, Wednesday, I started my first day of working for a web design + dev agency that focuses on Shopify sites. I&rsquo;ve never touched Shopify in my life (besides checking things out). I&rsquo;m learning to accept the discomfort of starting a new job, learning a whole new set of norms + tech stack for managing work + syntax (Shopify does use Liquid [ok actually they made it], which I have touched a little bit because Jekyll uses it too). I&rsquo;m blundering and hopefully reducing my learning:doing ratio (in favour of spending more time doing) over time. But anyway, it&rsquo;s 4 hours a day and pays me twice as much as any of my law internships ever did (which is more of a testament to how poorly law interns are paid).</p>
<h1 id="changing-lanes">Changing lanes</h1>
<p>After finishing 4 years of university, picking up this freelance thing felt like the first step in confirming my change of paths. I studied law, but won&rsquo;t be practicing as a lawyer as I genuinely don&rsquo;t think I can hack it. Some people can handle constant stress and 12-hour days, but not me. I&rsquo;ve got other priorities like my health and possible family caregiving stuff.</p>
<p>Ideally, I&rsquo;ll be able to do dev work that also taps on my legal training &ndash; like building tools for legal ecosystem folks (research, practice managements, blahblah). But for now, I&rsquo;m just going to focus on getting my foot in the door, feeding myself, and learning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of shame associated with not doing what you were trained for, but it&rsquo;s kind of natural to change. Optimistically viewed, it means that my time in university was genuinely transformative. I&rsquo;m a very different person from my 19 year old self now. The version of me 4 years from now will also probably feel like a whole different person.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>day 4</title><link>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-04-25-day-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tomoe.asia/posts/2022-04-25-day-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Not much from me today.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not much from me today.</p>

<h1 id="website-improvements">Website Improvements</h1>
<p>I was very happy about finally mapping my domain, but then realised it&rsquo;d return a 404 whenever i try to access tomoe.asia after pushing new changes and deploying.</p>
<p>When you go to your Github Pages site repo &gt; Settings &gt; Pages and type in a custom domain for github pages, it creates this CNAME file in the root of your repo. However, it turns out that static site generators (like Jekyll) can force push changes, which can overwrite the CNAME file (haven&rsquo;t figured out how exactly it works), which affects whether tomoe.asia resolves to get the content of my site. That was why tomoe.asia wouldn&rsquo;t work after I push changes and publish my site.</p>
